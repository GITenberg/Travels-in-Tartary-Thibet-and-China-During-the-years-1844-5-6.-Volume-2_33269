</a> the small town of Tang-Keou-Eul, by reason of the great
number of strangers, who are drawn thither from all quarters by
commerce.&nbsp; It was in one of these establishments, kept by a
family of Mussulmen, that we went to lodge.&nbsp; As we had
nothing to do with trade, we felt called upon candidly to
communicate the fact to the host, and to arrange the terms of our
living in his house; <!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>it was agreed that we should be there
as in a common hotel.&nbsp; All this was very well; but the
question was, what we were to do afterwards: what was to become
of us?&nbsp; This question incessantly engrossed our minds, and
tormented us not a little.</p>
<p>As far as Tang-Keou-Eul we had followed, with sufficient
continuity, the route we had traced out for ourselves; we might
even say that this portion of our journey had been successful
beyond all expectations.&nbsp; Now the business was to carry out
our plan, and to penetrate to Lha-Ssa, the capital of Thibet; an
undertaking which appeared bristling with almost insuperable
difficulties.&nbsp; Tang-Keou-Eul was our columns of Hercules,
with their depressing <i>ne plus ultra</i> (No farther shalt thou
go).&nbsp; However, we had already vanquished too many obstacles,
to be easily overcome by discouragement.&nbsp; We heard that
almost every year caravans proceeded from Tang-Keou-Eul, and
penetrated into the very heart of Thibet.&nbsp; We wanted nothing
more to confirm our determination.&nbsp; Whatever other people
had undertaken and executed, we assumed also to undertake and to
execute, as not being, probably, beyond our power.&nbsp; It was
therefore settled that the journey should be carried out to the
end, and that no one should say that Catholic missionaries had
less courage for the interest of the faith, than merchants for a
little profit.&nbsp; The possibility of departure being thus
determined we had nothing to seek but the opportunity.</p>
<p>Our great business, therefore, was to collect all possible
information respecting this famous route into Thibet.&nbsp; We
heard terrible things about it; we should have to travel for four
months through a country absolutely without inhabitants, and
should have, accordingly, to lay in before our departure all the
necessary provisions.&nbsp; In the season of winter, the cold was
so horrible that it often happened that travellers were frozen to
death or buried beneath the avalanches of snow; while, in summer,
a great number were drowned, for they had to cross large streams,
without bridge or boat, without other aid than that of animals,
which themselves often could not swim.&nbsp; Moreover, there were
hordes of brigands, who at certain periods of the year prowled
about the desert and stripped travellers and abandoned them,
without clothes or food, amidst these frightful plains; in short,
there was no end of stories, enough to make our hair stand on
end; and these stories, fabulous as they seemed, or, at least,
much exaggerated, were the same on every tongue,&mdash;were all
of a frightful uniformity.&nbsp; Besides, there were to be seen
and questioned in the streets of Tang-Keou-Eul, some
Tartar-Mongols, who were standing evidence of the truth of these
long narratives, being the remnants of a large caravan, which had
been attacked in the preceding year by a troop of brigands.&nbsp;
These had <!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>contrived to escape, but their
companions had been left to the mercy of the <i>Kolo</i>
(brigands).&nbsp; This information, while ineffectual to shake
our resolution, induced us to remain where we were, until a
favourable opportunity for departure should present itself.</p>
<p>We had been six days at Tang-Keou-Eul, when a small caravan of
Tartar-Khalkhas arrived at our House of Repose.&nbsp; It came
from the frontiers of Russia, and was on its way to Lha-Ssa to
offer up its adorations to a young child, which, the people were
informed, was the famous Guison-Tamba newly transmigrated.&nbsp;
When the Tartars learned that we were awaiting a favourable
opportunity for proceeding towards Thibet, they were delighted,
fully appreciating the fact that their troop, in this unexpected
accession of three pilgrims, received an accession, also, of
three combatants in the event of a fight with the Kolo.&nbsp; Our
beards and mustachios inspired them with an exalted idea of our
valour, and we were forthwith decorated by them with the title of
<i>Batourou</i> (braves).&nbsp; This was all exceedingly
honourable and seductive; but still, before we finally decided
upon joining the cavalcade, we thought it expedient to consider
the various aspects of the matter gravely and maturely.</p>
<p>The caravan which occupied the great court-yard of the House
of Repose, counted only eight men; the rest was camels, horses,
tents, baggage, and kitchen utensils; but then the eight men,
according to their own account, were perfect war dragons.&nbsp;
At all events, they were armed up to the teeth, and made a grand
display before us of their matchlocks, lances, bows and arrows,
and above all, of a piece of artillery, in the shape of a small
cannon, of the size of one&rsquo;s arm; it had no carriage, but
mounted between the two humps of a camel, it produced a very
formidable effect.&nbsp; All this warlike apparatus failed to
inspire us with confidence, and, on the other hand, we placed but
slight reliance upon the moral effect of our long beards.&nbsp;
It was necessary, however, to adopt a decided course; the
Tartar-Khalkhas urged us pressingly, assuring us of complete
success.&nbsp; Of the lookers on, disinterested in the matter one
way or the other, some told us that the opportunity was
altogether eligible, and that we ought by all means to avail
ourselves of it; while others assured us that it would be the
extreme of imprudence to proceed, for that so small a party would
be inevitably eaten up by the Kolo; and that it would be far
better, as we were in no immediate hurry, to wait for the great
Thibetian embassy.</p>
<p>Now this embassy having only just quitted Peking, would not
reach Tang-Keou-Eul for fully eight months, a delay which it
seemed absolutely ruinous for us to undergo.&nbsp; How, with our
modest means, were we to maintain ourselves and our five animals
for so long a time in an inn?&nbsp; After maturely calculating
and weighing <!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>everything: let us confide in the
protection of God, said we, and go forth.&nbsp; We announced our
resolution to the Tartars, who were highly delighted.&nbsp; We
immediately requested the host of the House of Repose to purchase
for us four months&rsquo; provision of meal.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do
you want with four months meal?&rdquo; asked the Tartars.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They say the journey is of at least three months&rsquo;
duration, and it is expedient, therefore, to provide for four
months, to meet the chance of accidents.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ay,
the Thibetian embassy occupies a long time on the journey, but we
Tartars travel in quite a different manner; we do the distance in
a moon and a-half at the very outside; we gallop the whole way,
so that we get over nearly 200 (twenty leagues) a
day.&rdquo;&nbsp; This intimation at once caused us to change our
resolution.&nbsp; It was manifestly quite impossible for us to
keep up with this caravan.&nbsp; In the first place, as to
ourselves, never having been accustomed, like the Tartars, to
forced marches, we should have been dead in three days; and as to
our animals, weary and worn with four months incessant toil, they
could not have for any length of time borne up against the pace
of our proposed companions.&nbsp; The Tartars having forty camels
could afford to knock up one-half of them.&nbsp; Indeed, they
themselves admitted that with our three camels, it was impossible
for us to undertake the journey with them, and they accordingly
advised us to buy a dozen others.&nbsp; The advice, excellent in
itself, was, with reference to the state of our exchequer,
absolutely absurd.&nbsp; Twelve good camels would have cost us
three hundred ounces of silver; now the total amount of our funds
was under two hundred ounces.</p>
<p>The eight Tartar-Khalkhas were all of princely blood, and,
accordingly, on the evening preceding their departure, they
received a visit from the son of the King of Koukou-Noor, who was
then at Tang-Keou-Eul.&nbsp; As the room we occupied was the
handsomest in the establishment, it was arranged that the
interview should take place there.&nbsp; The young Prince of
Koukou-Noor surprised us by his noble mien and the elegance of
his manners; it was obvious that he spent considerably more of
his time at Tang-Keou-Eul than in the Mongol tent.&nbsp; He was
attired in a handsome robe of light blue cloth, over which was a
sort of jacket of violet cloth, with a broad border of black
velvet.&nbsp; His left ear was decorated, in Thibetian fashion,
with a gold earring from which hung several trinkets; his
complexion was almost as fair as our own, and his countenance
admirably gentle in its expression: in utter contradistinction
from ordinary Tartars, his garments were exquisitely clean.&nbsp;
As the visit of a Prince of Koukou-Noor was quite an event, we
determined to be wholly regardless of expense in celebrating it;
and Samdadchiemba received, accordingly, orders to prepare a
banquet for his <!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>royal highness, that is to say, a
great pitcher of good, hot tea, with milk.&nbsp; His royal
highness deigned to accept a cup of this beverage, and the
remainder was distributed among his staff, who were in waiting
outside.&nbsp; The conversation turned upon the journey into
Thibet.&nbsp; The prince promised the Tartar-Khalkhas an escort
throughout his estates.&nbsp; &ldquo;Beyond that point,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;I can answer for nothing; you must take your
chance, good or bad, as shall happen.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then
addressing us, he advised us by all means to wait for the
Thibetian embassy, in whose company we should be able to travel
with greater ease and security.&nbsp; On taking leave, the royal
visitor drew from a purse elegantly embroidered, a small agate
snuff-box, and graciously offered to each of us a pinch.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Next morning the Tartar-Khalkhas proceeded on their
journey.&nbsp; When we saw them depart, a feeling of sorrow came
over us, for we would gladly have accompanied them had it been at
all practicable; but the sentiment soon subsided, and we applied
our thoughts to the best use we should make of our time while we
remained at Tang-Keou-Eul.&nbsp; It was at last determined that
we <!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>should procure a master, and devote ourselves entirely
to the study of the Thibetian language and of the Buddhist
books.</p>
<p>At eleven leagues from Tang-Keou-Eul there is, in the land of
the Si-Fan, or Eastern Thibetians, a Lamasery, whose fame extends
not merely throughout Tartary, but even to the remotest parts of
Thibet.&nbsp; Thither pilgrims flock from all quarters,
venerating; for there was born Tsong-Kaba-Remboutchi, the famous
reformer of Buddhism.&nbsp; The Lamasery bears the name of
Kounboum, and its Lama population numbers no fewer than 4,000
persons, Si-Fan, Tartars, Thibetians, and Dchiahours.&nbsp; It
was determined that one of us should visit this place, and
endeavour to engage a Lama to come and teach us for a few months
the Thibetian language.&nbsp; M. Gabet, accordingly, departed on
this mission, accompanied by Samdadchiemba, while M. Huc remained
at Tang-Keou-Eul, to take care of the animals and of the
baggage.</p>
<p>After an absence of five days, M. Gabet returned to the House
of Repose, eminently successful, having secured at the Lamasery
of Kounboum a perfect treasure in the person of a Lama who had
passed ten of the thirty-two years of his life in a grand
Lamasery at Lha-Ssa itself.&nbsp; He spoke pure Thibetian
perfectly, wrote it with facility, and was very learned in the
Buddhist books; moreover, he was quite familiar with several
other idioms, Si-Fan, Mongol, Chinese, and Dchiahour; in a word,
he was a philologist of the first water.&nbsp; This young Lama
was a Dchiahour by birth, and a cousin-german of Samdadchiemba;
his name was Sandara, and in the Lamasery he was called Sandara
the Bearded, by reason of the remarkable length of that appendage
in which he luxuriated.</p>
<p>The devotion which Samdadchiemba&rsquo;s cousin forthwith
manifested in our favour made us rejoice that we had not
adventured with the Tartar-Khalkha caravan, for here we were
placed in the precise position for procuring every requisite
information about Thibet, and of making ourselves acquainted at
the same time with the language and religion of that celebrated
region.</p>
<p>We applied ourselves to study with perfect enthusiasm.&nbsp;
First, we composed in Mongol two dialogues, comprehending the
most familiar conversational phrases.&nbsp; These Sandara
translated into Thibetian with scrupulous attention.&nbsp; Every
morning he wrote out a page in our presence, giving us a
grammatical commentary upon each expression, as he proceeded;
this was our lesson for the day, which we first transcribed
several times, in order to break our hand into the Thibetian
writing, and then chanted, in the manner of the Lamaseries, until
the whole page was thoroughly impressed upon the memory.&nbsp; In
the evening our master heard us recite the portion of dialogue he
had written for us in the morning, and <!-- page 19--><a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>rectified our
defects of pronunciation.&nbsp; Sandara acquitted himself of his
task with talent and amiability.&nbsp; From time to time in the
course of the day he would, by way of recreation, give us details
full of interest respecting Thibet and the Lamaseries he had
visited.&nbsp; It was impossible to listen to the descriptions
given by this young Lama without admiration; nowhere had we heard
a person express himself with greater facility or a more winning
manner; the simplest, commonest things became in his mouth
picturesque and full of charm; he was especially remarkable when
he sought to induce upon others any particular view of his own
upon some subject in which he really felt an interest.&nbsp; His
eloquence was then really powerful.</p>
<p>After having surmounted the first difficulties of the
Thibetian language, and familiarized ourselves with the
expressions in ordinary use, we proceeded to give our studies an
altogether religious direction.&nbsp; We got Sandara to translate
for us into the sacred style of his language some of the leading
Catholic forms, such as the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, the Salutation,
the Apostles&rsquo; Creed, the Commandments: and thereupon we
took occasion to explain to him the general truths of the
Christian religion.&nbsp; He seemed all at once struck with this
new doctrine, so different from the vague, incoherent
propositions of Buddhism.&nbsp; Before long he attached so much
importance to the study of the Christian religion that he
entirely laid aside the Lama books he had brought with him, and
applied himself to the acquisition of our prayers with an ardour
that made us truly joyful.&nbsp; From time to time in the course
of the day he would interrupt what he was about in order to make
the sign of the cross, and he practised this religious act in a
manner so grave and respectful that we thoroughly believed him to
have become a Christian at heart.&nbsp; The excellent tendencies
he manifested filled us with the most lively hopes, and we
gratefully viewed in Sandara an incipient apostle, destined one
day to labour with success in converting the sectaries of
Buddha.</p>
<p>While we three, master and pupils, were thus absorbed in
studies so important, Samdadchiemba, who had no sort of vocation
for things intellectual, passed his time lounging about the
streets of Tang-Keou-Eul and drinking tea.&nbsp; Not at all
pleased with this occupation of his time, we devised to withdraw
him from his idleness, and to utilise him in his special
character of cameleer.&nbsp; It was accordingly arranged that he
should take the three camels and pasture them in a valley of
Koukou-Noor, noted for the excellence and the abundance of its
pasturage.&nbsp; A Tartar of the locality promised to receive him
into his tent, and we rejoiced in the <!-- page 20--><a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>arrangement,
as effecting the double advantage of supplying Samdadchiemba with
an occupation in conformity with his tastes, and of giving our
camels better and less costly fodder.</p>
<p>By degrees, all the fine things that we had imagined in
Sandara, vanished like a dream.&nbsp; This young man, apparently
of devotion so pure and disinterested, was in reality a
dissipated knave, whose only aim was to ease us of our
sapeks.&nbsp; When he thought he had rendered himself essential
to us, he threw aside the mask, and placed himself undisguisedly
before us in all the detestability of his character: he became
insolent, haughty, overbearing.&nbsp; In his Thibetian lessons,
he substituted for the mild, gentle, insinuating tone of his
former instruction, manners the most insufferably harsh and
brutal, such as the worst tempered pedagogue would not betray
towards the poorest of his pupils.&nbsp; If we asked him for an
explanation which perhaps he had previously given, he would
assail us with such amenities as these: &ldquo;What! you learned
fellows want to have the same thing told you three times
over!&nbsp; Why, if I were to tell a donkey the same thing three
times over, he&rsquo;d remember it.&rdquo;&nbsp; We might easily,
no doubt, have cut short these impertinences by sending the man
back to his Lamasery; and, more than once, we were strongly
inclined to adopt this course, but, upon the whole, we thought it
better to undergo a little humiliation, than to deprive ourselves
of the services of a Lama whose talents were indisputable, and
who, therefore, might be of the greatest utility to us.&nbsp; His
very rudeness, we considered, would aid our progress in acquiring
the Thibetian language, for we were sure that he would not pass
over the most trivial fault in grammar or pronunciation, but, on
the contrary, would rate us for any such defects, in a style
eminently calculated to produce an abiding impression.&nbsp; This
system, though somewhat tedious, and decidedly displeasing to
one&rsquo;s self-love, was incomparably superior to the method
practised by the Chinese Christians towards the European
missionaries in giving them Chinese lessons.&nbsp; Partly from
politeness, partly from religious respect, they affect to be in
ecstasies with whatever their spiritual father-pupil says; and,
instead of frankly correcting the faults which naturally occur in
his expressions, they are rather disposed to imitate his
defective language, so that he may, with the less trouble to
himself, understand them, the result of which excessive
complaisance is, that the missionaries are put to grave
inconvenience when they seek to converse with pagans who, not
having the same devotion towards them, do not admit in them a
fine pronunciation, or a masterly knowledge of words.&nbsp; Upon
such occasions, how one regrets that one had not for a teacher
some Sandara the Bearded!&nbsp; Upon such considerations, we
resolved to <!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>keep our master with all his defects,
to endure his abuse, and to make the best and most we could of
him.&nbsp; As we found that our sapeks were his object, it was
agreed that we should pay him handsomely for his lessons; and,
moreover, we made up our minds to wink at his little knaveries,
and to affect to have no idea that he had an understanding with
the people who sold us our daily provisions.</p>
<p>Samdadchiemba had not been gone many days before he suddenly
re-appeared amongst us.&nbsp; He had been robbed by brigands who
had taken from him his entire provision of meal, butter, and
tea.&nbsp; For the last day and a half he had eaten nothing
whatever, and, of consequence, his voice was hollow, and his face
pale and haggard.&nbsp; Only seeing one camel in the court-yard,
we imagined that the two others had become the prey of the
brigands, but Samdadchiemba relieved us by the assurance that he
had confided them to the Tartar family who had granted him their
hospitality.&nbsp; Upon hearing this statement, Sandara knitted
his brows.&nbsp; &ldquo;Samdadchiemba,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you
are my younger brother, as it were; I have therefore a right to
ask you a few questions.&rdquo;&nbsp; And thereupon he submitted
the cameleer to an interrogatory characterised by all the depth
and subtlety of an able advocate cross-examining some cunning
offender.&nbsp; He demanded the minutest details, and applied
himself with infinite ingenuity to work up the contradictions
into which he involved the questioned party, and to put forward
in prominent relief the apparent improbability of his
story.&nbsp; How was it, he asked, that the robbers had stolen
the butter, yet left the bag in which the butter was
carried?&nbsp; How was it they had respected the little
snuff-bottle, yet carried off the embroidered purse which served
it as a cover.&nbsp; When he had finished his inquiries, he
added, with a malicious smile: &ldquo;I have put these few
questions to my brother out of pure curiosity; I attach no
importance to them.&nbsp; It is not I who have to disburse the
wherewithal to buy him fresh provisions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Samdadchiemba, meantime, was dying with hunger, so we gave him
some sapeks, and he went to dinner in a neighbouring
eating-house.&nbsp; As soon as he had quitted the room, Sandara
proceeded: &ldquo;Nobody shall ever persuade me that my brother
has been robbed.&nbsp; The brigands in this part of the country
don&rsquo;t do their work in the way he wants to make out.&nbsp;
The fact is, that Samdadchiemba, when he got among the Tartars,
wanted to show off, and distributed his provisions right and left
in order to make friends.&nbsp; He had no reason to fear being
lavish; what he gave away cost him nothing.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
probity of Samdadchiemba was a fact so thoroughly impressed upon
our convictions, that we altogether repudiated this wicked <!--
page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>insinuation, which we clearly saw proceeded at once from
Sandara&rsquo;s jealous annoyance at the confidence we reposed in
his cousin, and from a cunning desire, in giving us the idea that
he was warmly attached to our interest, to divert our attention
from his own petty peculations.&nbsp; We gave Samdadchiemba, who
did not at all perceive his relative&rsquo;s treachery, some more
provisions, and he returned to the pastures of Koukou-Noor.</p>
<p>Next day, the town of Tang-Keou-Eul was the scene of terrible
disorder.&nbsp; The brigands had made their appearance in the
vicinity, and had driven off 2000 head of cattle belonging to the
tribe called <i>Houng-Mao-Eul</i> (Long Hairs).&nbsp; These
Eastern Thibetians quit once a-year the slopes of the Bayan-Khara
mountains in large caravans, and come to Tang-Keou-Eul to sell
furs, butter, and a kind of wild fruit that grows in their
district.&nbsp; While they are engaged in these commercial
operations, they leave their large herds in the vast prairies
that abut upon the town, and which are under the jurisdiction of
the Chinese authorities.&nbsp; There was no example, we heard, of
the brigands having ventured to approach so close as this to the
frontiers of the Empire.&nbsp; This present audacity of theirs,
and more especially the known violence of character of the Long
Hairs, contributed to throw the whole town into utter dismay and
confusion.&nbsp; Upon hearing of their loss the Long Hairs had
tumultuously rushed to the Chinese tribunal, and, their long
sabres in their hands, lightning in their eyes, and thunder in
their mouths, had demanded justice and vengeance.&nbsp; The
terrified Mandarin instantly despatched 200 soldiers in pursuit
of the robbers.&nbsp; But the Long Hairs, seeing that these foot
soldiers could never overtake the brigands, who were well
mounted, threw themselves into their saddles, and dashed off in
search of the thieves.&nbsp; They returned next day with no other
result attained than that their fury was redoubled.&nbsp;
Altogether destitute of foresight, these half-savages had gone
off without any provisions whatever, never thinking that, in the
desert, they would find nothing to eat.&nbsp; Accordingly, after
a day&rsquo;s forced march, hunger had compelled them to
return.&nbsp; Not so the Chinese soldiers.&nbsp; These worthies,
knowing much better what they were about, had provided themselves
for their warlike expedition with infinite asses and oxen laden
with apparatus for the kitchen, and with ammunition for the
mouth.&nbsp; As they felt no sort of desire to go and fight for
2000 cattle that did not belong to them, after a very brief
military progress they halted on the bank of a river, where they
spent several days, eating, drinking, and amusing themselves, and
giving no more heed to the brigands than though there had never
been such personages in the world.&nbsp; When they had consumed
all their provisions they returned quietly to <!-- page 23--><a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>Tang-Keou-Eul, and declared to the Mandarin that they
had scoured the desert without being able to come up with the
robbers; that once, indeed, these had seemed within their grasp,
but that, availing themselves of their magic powers, they had
vanished.&nbsp; At Tang-Keou-Eul everybody is persuaded that the
brigands are all more or less sorcerers, and that in order to
render themselves invisible, all they have to do is to exhale in
a particular manner, or to throw some sheep&rsquo;s treddles
behind them.&nbsp; It is probably the Chinese soldiers who have
brought these fables into vogue; at all events they certainly
make excellent use of them in all their expeditions.&nbsp; The
Mandarins, doubtless, are not their dupes; but provided the
victims of the robbers are content with these tales, that is all
the Chinese authorities care about.</p>
<p>For several days the Houng-Mao-Eul were perfectly
furious.&nbsp; They ran about the streets like madmen,
flourishing their sabres and vociferating a thousand imprecations
against the brigands.&nbsp; All the townspeople got carefully out
of their way, respecting their anger with entire
veneration.&nbsp; The appearance of these fellows even at their
very best, when they are perfectly calm and good humoured, is
sufficiently alarming.&nbsp; They are clothed at all seasons of
the year in a great sheepskin robe, rudely drawn up round the
waist by a thick camel-hair rope.&nbsp; Left to itself this robe
would drag along the ground, so that when raised by the cord
above the knees it communicates to the chest a most rotund,
stuffed, and awkward appearance.&nbsp; They have great leather
boots, which come up to just below the knee, so that, as they
wear no trousers, their legs are always half bare.&nbsp; Their
hair, black and greasy, hangs in long matted locks down their
shoulders, and, in fact, falling over the brow, half conceals the
face.&nbsp; The right arm is always bare, the sleeve being thrown
quite back.&nbsp; A long, broad sabre is passed through their
girdle just below the chest, and the right hand scarcely ever
quits its hilt.&nbsp; The manners and movements of these
inhabitants of the desert are abrupt and jerking, their speech
brief and energetic.&nbsp; The tones of their voice have
something about them metallic and deafening.&nbsp; Many of them
are wealthy, and with these display consists in decorating the
sheath of the sword with precious stones, and their own robes
with borders of tiger-skin.&nbsp; The horses which they bring to
Tang-Keou-Eul are remarkably beautiful, vigorous, well made, and
of great grandeur in the step: in all respects far superior to
those of Tartary, and fully justifying the Chinese phrase,
<i>Sima</i>, <i>Toung-nieou</i> (Western horses&mdash;eastern
oxen.)</p>
<p>The Houng-Mao-Eul, being famous for their bravery and for an
independence which amounts to the ferocious, it is they who give
<!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>the <i>ton</i> to the people of Tang-Keou-Eul, who all
essay to catch their air and gait, and to acquire a reputation
for valour and devil-may-carishness.&nbsp; The result is, that
Tang-Keou-Eul bears a strong family resemblance to a great den of
thieves.&nbsp; Everybody there makes it his business to have his
hair and clothes in utter disorder, everybody bawls at everybody,
everybody pushes against everybody, everybody fights everybody,
so that everybody from time to time draws everybody&rsquo;s
blood.&nbsp; In the depth of winter, though the winter here is
desperately cold, people go about with their arms and half their
legs bare.&nbsp; To wear clothing adapted to the icy season would
be considered a mark of pusillanimity.&nbsp; A good brave fellow,
they say, should fear nothing, neither men nor elements.&nbsp; At
Tang-Keou-Eul the Chinese themselves have lost much of their
urbanity and of the polished forms of their language, having
involuntarily undergone the influence of the Houng-Mao-Eul, who
converse together in much the same style that we can imagine
tigers in the woods to converse.&nbsp; On the day of our arrival
at Tang-Keou-Eul, a few minutes before we entered the town, we
met a Long Hair who had been giving his horse drink in the River
Keou-Ho.&nbsp; Samdadchiemba, who was always attracted by
anything having an eccentric air, cautiously approached the man,
and saluted him in the Tartar fashion, saying, &ldquo;Brother,
art thou at peace?&rdquo;&nbsp; The Houng-Mao-Eul turned fiercely
towards him: &ldquo;What business of thine is it,
tortoise-egg,&rdquo; cried he, with the voice of a Stentor,
&ldquo;whether I am at peace or at war?&nbsp; And what right hast
thou to address as thy brother a man who knows nothing about
thee?&rdquo;&nbsp; Poor Samdadchiemba was taken all aback at this
reception, yet he could not help admiring, as something very
fine, this haughty insolence of the Long Hair.</p>
<p>Tang-Keou-Eul, in consequence of its dirt and its excessive
population, is a very unwholesome place to live in.&nbsp; There
is an universal odour of grease and butter about, that is enough
to make you sick.&nbsp; In certain quarters, more particularly
where the especial poor and the especial vagabonds congregate,
the stench is insupportable.&nbsp; Those who have no house
wherein to shelter themselves, collect in the nooks of streets
and squares, and there they lie, higgledy-piggledy, and half
naked, upon filthy straw, or rather, dung-heaps.&nbsp; There are
stretched together the sick young, and the infirm old, the dying
man, sometimes the dead, whom no one takes the trouble to bury,
until, at length, putrefaction manifesting itself, the bodies are
dragged into the middle of the street, whence the authorities
remove them, and have them thrown into some general pit.&nbsp;
From amid this hideous misery there pullulates into the bosom of
the population, a crowd of petty thieves and swindlers, who, in
<!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>their address and audacity, leave far behind the Robert
Macaires of the western world.&nbsp; The number of these wretched
creatures is so great, that authority, weary of contending with
them, has left them to take their own course, and the public to
guard their own sapeks and goods.&nbsp; These worthies work, as a
matter of preference, in the houses of repose and the inns.&nbsp;
Their <i>modus operandi</i> is this: Two of them, associated
together for the purpose, hawk about various articles of
merchandise, boots, skin-coats, bricks of tea, and what
not.&nbsp; They offer these for sale to travellers.&nbsp; While
one of them engages the attention of the destined victim, by
displaying his goods and bargaining, the other ferrets about and
pockets whatever he can lay his hands on.&nbsp; These rascals
have inconceivable skill in counting your sapeks for you, in such
a way as to finger fifty or a hundred or more of them without
your having the slightest notion as to what is going on.&nbsp;
One day, two of these little thieves came to offer for our
purchase a pair of leathern boots.&nbsp; Excellent boots! said
they; boots such as we could not find in any shop in the whole
town; boots that would keep out the rain for days; and as to
cheapness, perfectly unexampled.&nbsp; If we missed this
opportunity, we should never have such another.&nbsp; Only just
before they had been offered 1200 sapeks for them!&nbsp; As we
did not want boots, we replied that we would not have them at any
price.&nbsp; Thereupon the acting merchant assumed a lofty tone
of generosity.&nbsp; We were foreigners; we should have them for
1000 sapeks, 900, 800, 700.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said we,
&ldquo;we certainly don&rsquo;t want any boots just now, yet,
doubtless, as you say, these are very cheap, and it will be worth
while to buy them as a reserve.&rdquo;&nbsp; The bargain was
accordingly concluded; we took our purse, and counted out 700
sapeks to the merchant, who counted them over himself, under our
very eyes, pronounced the amount correct, and once more laid the
coin before us.&nbsp; He then called out to his companion who was
poking about in the court-yard: &ldquo;Here, I&rsquo;ve sold
these capital boots for 700 sapeks.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; cried the other, &ldquo;700 sapeks! I
won&rsquo;t hear of such a thing.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Very
well,&rdquo; said we; &ldquo;come, take your boots and be off
with you.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was off, and so quickly, that we
thought it expedient to count our sapeks once more; there were a
hundred and fifty of them gone, and that was not all; while one
of these rascals had been pocketing our money under our very
nose, the other had bagged two great iron pins that we had driven
into the court-yard for the purpose of our camels.&nbsp;
Therefore we took a resolution&mdash;better late than
never&mdash;to admit, in future, no merchant whatever into our
room.</p>
<p>The House of Repose, as we have already indicated, was kept by
Musselmen.&nbsp; One day, their Mufti, who had recently arrived
<!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>from Lan-Tcheu, the capital of Kan-Sou, attended at the
house, in order to preside over some religious ceremony, the
nature and object of which they would not explain to us.&nbsp;
Sandara the Bearded, however, had an explanation of his own,
which was, that the Grand Lama of the Hoei-Hoei attended on these
occasions to teach his sectaries the latest improvements in the
art of cheating in trade.&nbsp; For two days, the principal
Mussulmen of the town assembled in a large apartment, contiguous
to our own.&nbsp; There they remained for a long time, squatting
on the ground, with their heads resting on their knees.&nbsp;
When the Mufti appeared, all sent forth groans and sobs.&nbsp;
After they had sufficiently lamented in this fashion, the Mufti
recited, with a perfectly alarming volubility of tongue, several
Arabic prayers; then everybody had another turn at lamenting,
after which the cheerful assembly separated.&nbsp; This doleful
ceremony was performed thrice in each of the two first
days.&nbsp; On the morning of the third day, all the Mussulmen
ranged themselves in the court-yard round the Mufti, who was
seated on a stool, covered with a fine red carpet.&nbsp; Then the
host of the House of Repose brought in a fine sheep, adorned with
flowers and ribbons.&nbsp; The sheep was laid on its side, the
host held it by its head, and two other Mussulmen by the legs,
while a fourth presented to the Mufti a knife on a silver
dish.&nbsp; He took the knife with great gravity, and approaching
the victim, thrust the weapon up to the hilt into its neck.&nbsp;
Thereupon cries and groans once more resounded on all
sides.&nbsp; These ceasing, the sheep was skinned, cut up, and
taken into the kitchen to be cooked, and, by-and-by, a grand
entertainment of boiled mutton, presided over by the Mufti,
closed the ceremony.</p>
<p>The Mussulmen, or Hoei-Hoei, are very numerous in China.&nbsp;
It is said that they penetrated thither under the dynasty of the
Thang, which began in 618, and terminated in 907.&nbsp; They were
received by the Emperor, who at that period resided at
Si-Ngan-Fou, the present capital of Chan-Si.&nbsp; They were
kindly entertained, and the Emperor, struck with their fine
features and forms, loaded them with favours, and entreated them
to settle in his dominions.&nbsp; At first, it is stated, they
were only 200 in number, but they have since so multiplied, that
they now constitute a large population, eminently formidable to
the Chinese.&nbsp; Kan-Sou, Yun-Nan, Sse-Tchouan, Chan-Si,
Chen-si, Chang-Toung, Pe-Tche-Ly, and Liao-Toung are the
provinces in which they are most numerous.&nbsp; In some
particular localities, indeed, they form the majority of the
population, as compared with the Chinese.&nbsp; They have,
however, become so mingled, so fused with the native people, that
it would be difficult now-a-days to recognise them, were it not
for the small blue cap which they all constantly wear, to
distinguish themselves <!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>from the Chinese.&nbsp; Their
physiognomy has retained no vestige of its original type.&nbsp;
Their nose has become flat, their eyes have sunk in, their cheek
bones started out.&nbsp; They do not know a single word of
Arabic&mdash;a language which their priests alone are bound to
learn, and this only so as to read it.&nbsp; Chinese has become
their stepmother tongue; yet they have preserved a certain energy
of character which you seldom find among the Chinese.&nbsp;
Though few in number, as compared with the enormous general
population of the empire, they have ensured for themselves the
fear and respect of all about them.&nbsp; Closely united among
themselves, the entire community always takes up any matter
affecting one of its members.&nbsp; It is to this spirit of
association that they owe the religious liberty which they enjoy
throughout all the provinces of the empire.&nbsp; No person would
venture, in their presence, to cavil at their religious creed, or
their religious practices.&nbsp; They abstain from smoking, from
drinking wine, from eating pork, from sitting at table with
pagans; and no one presumes to find fault with these
peculiarities.&nbsp; They do not even hesitate to contravene the
laws of the empire, if these contravene their freedom of
worship.&nbsp; In 1840, while we were on our mission to Tartary,
the Hoei-Hoei of the town of Hada, built a mosque, or Li-Pai-Sse,
as the Chinese call it.&nbsp; When it was completed, the
Mandarins of the place wanted to demolish it, because, contrary
to the law, it rose higher than the Tribunal of Justice.&nbsp;
Upon this intention becoming known, all the Mussulmen of the
locality rose in arms, assembled, swore to prosecute in common a
suit against the Mandarins, to impeach them at Peking, and never
to lay down their arms until they had effected the removal of the
offending dignitaries.&nbsp; As in China, money has the
preponderant influence in all matters of this kind, the Mussulmen
of Hada raised a subscription among all their co-religionists in
the empire, and by its means defeated the Mandarins, who had
desired to demolish their mosques, and effected their deposition
and banishment.&nbsp; We have often asked each other how it was
that the Christians in China live in a state of oppression,
wholly at the arbitrary disposition of the tribunals, while the
Mussulmen march about with heads erect, and constrain the Chinese
to respect their religion.&nbsp; It certainly is not because the
religion of Mahomet is, more than Christianity, in harmony with
Chinese manners; quite the contrary, for the Chinese may, without
any compromise of their religious duties, live in intimacy with
the Pagans, eat and drink with them, interchange presents with
them, and celebrate in common with them the Festival of the New
Year, all which things are forbidden to the Hoei-Hoei by the
despotic and exclusive spirit of their religion.&nbsp; No: that
the Christians are everywhere oppressed in China is to be <!--
page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>attributed to the great isolation in which they
live.&nbsp; If one of them is taken before a tribunal, all his
brethren in the locality get out of the way, instead of coming in
a body to his aid and awing by their numbers the aggressive
Mandarins.&nbsp; Now, more especially, that imperial decrees have
been issued favourable to Christianity, if the Christians were to
rise simultaneously in all parts of the empire, were
energetically to assume possession of their rights, giving
publicity to their worship, and exercising fearlessly, and in the
face of day, their religious practices, we are satisfied that no
one would venture to interfere with them.&nbsp; In China, as
everywhere else, men are free who manifest the will to be so; and
that will can only be effectively developed by the spirit of
association.</p>
<p>We were now approaching the first day of the Chinese year, and
in every direction people were preparing for its
celebration.&nbsp; The sentences, written on red paper, which
decorate the fronts of houses, were renewed; the shops were
filled with purchasers; there was redoubled activity of
operations in every quarter, while the children, ever eager to
anticipate holidays and entertainments, were discharging, each
evening, preliminary fireworks in the streets.&nbsp; Sandara
informed us that he could not pass the Festival of the New Year
at Tang-Keou-Eul, being obliged to return to the Lamasery, where
he had duties to fulfil towards his masters and superiors.&nbsp;
He added, that on the third day of the new moon, when he had
satisfied all his obligations, he would come back and resume his
services.&nbsp; He spoke in a tone of intense kindliness, in
order to make us forget the daily impertinences he had been
guilty of towards us.&nbsp; We did not at all urge him to
return.&nbsp; Though delighted at the prospect of renewing our
studies with him, we were determined not to seem anxious about
the matter, lest we should raise still higher the already
preposterous estimate he had of his own importance.&nbsp; We told
him that since propriety recalled him to the Lamasery for the
first day of the year, he ought by all means to obey the
call.&nbsp; We then offered him three rolls of sapeks, saying,
according to the custom in such cases, that it was to enable him
to drink with his friends a cup of high-coloured tea.&nbsp; For
some minutes he feigned that he would not accept the coin, but at
last we overcame his exquisite delicacy, and he consented to put
the sapeks in his pocket.&nbsp; We then lent him
Samdadchiemba&rsquo;s mule, and he left us.</p>
<p>The last days of the year are ordinarily, with the Chinese,
days of anger and of mutual annoyance; for having at this period
made up their accounts, they are vehemently engaged in getting
them in; and every Chinese being at once creditor and debtor,
every Chinese is just now hunting his debtors and hunted by his
creditors.&nbsp; He <!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>
<a href="images/p29.jpg">
<img class='clearcenter' alt=
"Pawnbroker&rsquo;s Shop"

</a> who returns from his neighbour&rsquo;s house, which he has
been throwing into utter confusion by his clamorous demands for
what that neighbour owes him, finds his own house turned inside
out by an uproarious creditor, and so the thing goes round.&nbsp;
The whole town is a scene of vociferation, disputation, and
fighting.&nbsp; On the last day of the year disorder attains its
height; people rush in all directions with anything they can
scratch together, to raise money upon, at the broker&rsquo;s or
pawnbroker&rsquo;s, the shops of which tradespeople are
absolutely besieged throughout the day with profferers of
clothes, bedding, furniture, cooking utensils, and moveables of
every description.&nbsp; Those who have already cleared their
houses in this way, and yet have not satisfied the demands upon
them, post off to their relations and friends to borrow something
or other which they vow shall be returned immediately, but which
immediately takes its way to the Tang-Pou, or
pawnbroker&rsquo;s.&nbsp; This species of anarchy continues till
midnight; then, calm resumes its sway.&nbsp; No one, after the
twelfth hour has struck, can claim a debt, or even make the
slightest allusion to it.&nbsp; You now only hear the words of
peace and good-will; everybody fraternizes with everybody.&nbsp;
Those who <!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>were just before on the point of
twisting their neighbour&rsquo;s neck, now twine their friendly
arms about it.</p>
<p>The new year is celebrated in much the same way as in
Europe.&nbsp; Everybody dresses as fine as he possibly can;
formal and informal visits are exchanged; presents circulate;
dinners and parties are given; people go to see the play, the
jugglers, and so on.&nbsp; Fireworks startle you at every turn;
there is nothing going on but merry-making.&nbsp; After a few
days, the shops are once more opened, and business imperceptibly
resumes its course; at least with those who can carry it on:
those who can&rsquo;t, declare themselves bankrupt, or, as the
Chinese phrase it, leave the door open.</p>
<p>The Hoei-Hoei do not keep the new year at the same time with
the Chinese, for in their special calendar they observe the
Hegira of Mahomet.&nbsp; Owing to this circumstance, we passed
these days of disorder and tumult in the greatest
tranquillity.&nbsp; The epoch assigned for the recovery of debts
was, in the place where we lodged, indicated merely by a few
disputes, followed immediately by profound quiet.&nbsp; The House
of Repose was not even disturbed by fire-works.&nbsp; We availed
ourselves of this tranquillity, and of the absence of Sandara, to
go thoroughly over our Thibetian lessons.&nbsp; The two dialogues
we possessed were analysed, decomposed, subjected to the
intellectual alembic, in every way and in every detail.&nbsp;
Housekeeping cares occupied, indeed, a portion of our day time;
but we made up for this by borrowing a few hours from the night,
an arrangement which did not at all suit our host, who, finding
that it involved him in an extra outlay for light, not only cut
off our supplies, by removing the oil bottle, but, like the
regular Turk he was, put on a charge per diem for light.&nbsp; As
we did not choose to be condemned to darkness in this way, we
bought a packet of candles, and constructed, with a long nail and
the half of a carrot, a candlestick, not remarkable, indeed, for
elegance or costliness, but which perfectly fulfilled its
office.&nbsp; When the Turk&rsquo;s dole of oil was consumed, we
lighted our candle, and we were thus able to give free course to
the ardour of our Thibetian studies.&nbsp; Sometimes we would
interrupt our labours to indulge in the relaxation of talking
about France; and after this, rambling for awhile in spirit, over
our dear native land, it was with a certain amount of difficulty
only, that we could resume the realities of our position.&nbsp;
It seemed strange, impossible almost, that we two should be
seated there, amid the silent night, poring over Thibetian
characters, in a country well nigh at the extremity of the world,
and practically unknown to Europeans.</p>
<p>On the third day of the first moon, Sandara the Bearded
reappeared.&nbsp; During his absence we had enjoyed such
delightful calm, <!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>that his aspect occasioned within us
a very painful sensation; we felt like schoolboys alarmed at the
approach of a severe preceptor.&nbsp; Sandara, however, was
charmingly amiable.&nbsp; After gracefully wishing us a happy new
year, in the most paternal, the most sentimental of phraseology,
he proceeded to discourse upon the little mule we had lent
him.&nbsp; First, on their way out, the little mule had thrown
him a dozen times, so that at last he had resolved to walk; but
then the creature was so droll, so fantastic in its ways, had so
amused him, that he had not had time to grow tired.&nbsp; After
this and similar small talk, we proceeded to business.&nbsp;
Sandara said, that since we were determined to wait for the
Thibetian embassy, he invited us to go and reside meanwhile in
the Lamasery at Kounboum; and thereupon, with his accustomed
eloquence, he descanted upon the advantages presented by a
Lamasery to men of study and prayer.&nbsp; The proposition met
the very wish of our hearts; but we took care not to manifest any
enthusiasm in the matter, contenting ourselves with replying,
coldly: &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll see how we like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day was devoted to the preparations for
departure.&nbsp; Not having our camels with us, we hired a car,
on which to transport our baggage.&nbsp; In announcing our
departure to the host of the House of Repose, we claimed our
tent, which we had lent him twelve days before, for a picnic
party that he said he had formed with some friends into the Land
of Grass; he replied, that he would send for it immediately to
the friend&rsquo;s house, where it was carefully stowed
away.&nbsp; We waited, but in vain; night came, the tent did
not.&nbsp; At last, the host told us that his friend had left
home for a day or two, and that the tent was locked up; but that
it should be sent after us so soon as his friend returned.&nbsp;
Sandara had hitherto said nothing; but when night came, and he
found that we were not ready, he could no longer restrain his
impatience.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite obvious,&rdquo; said he
to us, &ldquo;that you are people altogether of another world;
why don&rsquo;t you understand that your tent is at the
pawnbroker&rsquo;s?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;At the
pawnbroker&rsquo;s?&nbsp; Impossible!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is
not at all impossible; it is considerably more than probable; the
Hoei-Hoei wanted money wherewith to pay his debts at the end of
the twelfth moon; he was delighted to find you with him in the
emergency; he borrowed your tent, and he took it
straight&mdash;not to the Land of Grass, but to the House of
Pledges; and now he hasn&rsquo;t got the money to redeem it
with.&nbsp; Just have him up: I&rsquo;ll put the matter to him,
and you&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;&nbsp; We requested the host to come
to us.&nbsp; As soon as he entered the chamber, Sandara the
Bearded commenced his interrogatory with imposing
solemnity.&nbsp; &ldquo;Listen to me,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;this
evening I have a few words to say to you.&nbsp; You are a
Turk&mdash;I a Lama, yet the laws of reason are <!-- page 32--><a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>the same for
both of us.&nbsp; You have taken our tent, and you have carried
it to the pawnbroker&rsquo;s; if you were in an embarrassed
position, you did quite right; we do not reproach you; but we
depart to-morrow, and our tent is not yet here.&nbsp; Which of us
has reason on his side? we in claiming our property, or you in
not restoring it?&nbsp; Do not tell us that the tent is at a
friend&rsquo;s: I tell you that it is at the
pawnbroker&rsquo;s.&nbsp; If, by the time we have drunk this jug
of tea, our tent is not brought back, I will myself go to the
magistrate to demand that it be given up to us, and we shall see
whether a Lama-Dchiahour is to be oppressed by a
Turk.&rdquo;&nbsp; By way of peroration to this harangue, Sandara
gave such a thump with his fist upon the table, that our three
cups performed a caper in the air.&nbsp; The Turk had nothing to
say, and it was manifest that our tent was really at the
pawnbroker&rsquo;s.&nbsp; After a moment&rsquo;s pause, the host
assured us that we should have our property immediately, and he
entreated us earnestly not to mention the matter abroad, lest it
should compromise his establishment.&nbsp; We had scarcely
quitted our room, before there arose a grand confusion in the
court-yard; the attendants were collecting everything they could
lay their hands upon, saddles, bed clothes, candlesticks, kitchen
utensils, wherewith to redeem the tent, which, before we slept,
we saw securely packed on the car which was to convey it to the
Lamasery.</p>
<p>Next morning, at daybreak, we proceeded on our journey.&nbsp;
The country through which we passed is occupied here by the
Si-Fan, who lead a nomad life, and merely use the land as
pasturage for their cattle,&mdash;whereas the Chinese, as in
Eastern Tartary, are gradually encroaching upon the desert,
building houses, and bringing into cultivation portions of the
Land of Grass.&nbsp; Our brief voyage presented nothing
remarkable, except, indeed, that in crossing a small river upon
the ice, the car turned over and went to pieces.&nbsp; In France,
in order to continue our journey, we should have needed a
wheelwright and a smith to repair the damage; but fortunately our
Phaeton was a Chinese, that is to say, a man who is never at a
loss; and, accordingly, with a large stone, some bits of stick,
and some ends of rope, he soon put everything to rights, and we
merely lost a little time.</p>
<p>At the distance of a li from the Lamasery we found four Lamas,
friends of Sandara, who had come to meet us.&nbsp; Their
religious costume, the red scarf that enveloped them, their
mitre-shaped yellow caps, their modest mien, the low, grave tones
of their voices, all this produced a marked impression upon us,
and we felt as though a perfume of religious and cenobitic life
was diffused around us.&nbsp; It was past nine in the evening
when we reached the first <!-- page 33--><a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>
<a href="images/p33.jpg">
<img class='clearcenter' alt=
"Accident on the Ice"
title=
"Accident on the Ice"
src="images/p33.jpg" />
</a> dwellings of the Lamasery.&nbsp; To avoid disturbing the
profound silence which reigned everywhere about, the Lamas made
the carman stop, and filled with straw the interior of the bells
which hung from the horses&rsquo; necks.&nbsp; We then advanced
slowly, and without saying a word, along the calm deserted
streets of this great Lamanesque city.&nbsp; The moon was not
present; but the sky was so clear, so pure, and the stars were so
brilliant, that we could perfectly distinguish the cottages of
the Lamas spread over the sides of the mountain, and the grand,
though fantastic outlines of the Buddhist temples, standing out
in the air like gigantic phantoms.&nbsp; That which most struck
us at the moment, was the majestic and solemn silence which
prevailed throughout the Lamasery, and which was interrupted only
by the short sleepy bark of some half-wakened dog, like the
scream of the sea-eagle, or the melancholy sound of a marine
shell marking, at intervals, the watches of the night.&nbsp; We
at length reached Sandara&rsquo;s cottage.&nbsp; As it was too
late for us to seek a suitable lodging, our teacher gave us up
his own habitation, and himself sought the hospitality of a
neighbour.&nbsp; The Lamas <!-- page 34--><a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>who had
accompanied us did not withdraw until they had made for us some
tea with milk, and set before us some mutton, some fresh butter,
and some exquisite rolls.&nbsp; We supped with excellent
appetite, for we were thoroughly hungry, and, moreover, we
experienced in our inmost heart a feeling of peculiar
contentment, for which it seemed difficult to account.</p>
<p>We attempted to sleep, but it was in vain; slumber would not
come near us; our minds, indeed, were too full of the strange
position in which we now found ourselves.&nbsp; The whole thing
appeared quite inconceivable.&nbsp; There were we, in this land
of Amdo, unknown to Europe; in this great Lamasery of Kounboum,
so famous, so venerated among Buddhists, in the cell of one of
its ablest Lamas, amidst conventual manners altogether new to us;
all these and analogous considerations whirled through and about
the brain, like the vague intangible forms of a dream.&nbsp; We
passed the night framing all sorts of plans.</p>
<p>As soon as day began to dawn we were on foot.&nbsp; Around us
all was still silent.&nbsp; We offered up our morning prayer, our
hearts agitated with sentiments altogether new to us in their
peculiar character; with mingled joy and pride that it had been
thus vouchsafed to us to invoke the true God in this famous
Lamasery, consecrated to a lying and impious worship.&nbsp; It
seemed to us as though we were about to grasp universal Buddhism
within the paternal arms of the Christian faith.</p>
<p>Sandara soon made his appearance, and prepared for our
breakfast some tea with milk, raisins, and cakes fried in
butter.&nbsp; While we were occupied with our meal, he opened a
small cupboard, and took out a wooden plate, highly polished, and
decorated with gilding and flowers, upon a red ground.&nbsp;
After wiping it carefully with his scarf, he placed upon it a
broad sheet of pink paper, then, upon the paper, he symmetrically
arranged four fine pears, which he had directed us to buy at
Tang-Keou-Eul, and then he covered the whole with a silk
handkerchief, of oblong form, called in these countries
Khata.&nbsp; &ldquo;With this,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we will go
and borrow a lodging for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Khata, or Scarf of Blessings, is so prominent a feature in
Thibetian manners, that we may as well give an account of
it.&nbsp; The Khata, then, is a piece of silk, nearly as fine as
gauze, and of so very pale a blue as to be almost white.&nbsp;
Its length about triples its breadth, and the two extremities are
generally fringed.&nbsp; There are Khatas of all sizes and all
prices, for a Khata is an object with which neither poor nor rich
can dispense.&nbsp; No one ever moves unless provided with a
supply.&nbsp; When you go to pay a visit, when you go to ask a
favour, or to acknowledge one, you <!-- page 35--><a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>begin with
displaying the Khata; you take it in both hands, and offer it to
the person whom you desire to honour.&nbsp; When two friends, who
have not seen each other for a long time, meet, their first
proceeding is to interchange a Khata; it is as much a matter of
course as shaking hands in Europe.&nbsp; When you write, it is
usual to enclose a Khata in the letter.&nbsp; We cannot
exaggerate the importance which the Thibetians, the Si-Fan, the
Houng-Mao-Eul, and all the people who dwell towards the western
shores of the Blue Sea, attach to the ceremony of the
Khata.&nbsp; With them, it is the purest and sincerest expression
of all the noblest sentiments.&nbsp; The most gracious words, the
most magnificent presents go for nothing, if unaccompanied with
the Khata; whereas, with the Khata, the commonest objects become
of infinite value.&nbsp; If any one comes, Khata in hand, to ask
you a favour, to refuse the favour would be a great breach of
propriety.&nbsp; This Thibetian custom is very general among the
Tartars, and especially in their Lamaseries; and Khatas
accordingly form a very leading feature of commerce with the
Chinese at Tang-Keou-Eul.&nbsp; The Thibetian embassy never
passes through the town without purchasing a prodigious number of
these articles.</p>
<p>When we had finished our modest breakfast, we issued forth in
search of a lodging.&nbsp; Sandara the Bearded preceded us,
bearing gravely on both hands the famous dish of four
pears.&nbsp; This proceeding seemed to us so strange, that we
were altogether confused, imagining that the entire population
would have their eyes fixed upon us.&nbsp; Nothing of the sort:
the Lamas, whom we met, passed silently on, without even turning
their heads, or paying the slightest attention to us in any
way.&nbsp; The little chabis, harum-scarum rogues in common with
schoolboys all over the world, alone seemed to notice our
presence.&nbsp; At last we entered a house.&nbsp; The master was
in the court-yard, drying horse droppings in the sun.&nbsp; Upon
perceiving us, he immediately enveloped himself in his scarf, and
entered his cell.&nbsp; We followed him thither, and Sandara
presented to him the Khata and the plate of pears, accompanying
the present with an harangue in the East Thibetian tongue, of
which we did not understand one single word.&nbsp; Meanwhile, we
stood humbly apart, like poor wretches incapable even of
soliciting a favour for themselves.&nbsp; When the harangue was
completed, the host invited us to seat ourselves on the carpet,
presented to each a cup of tea with milk, and told us, in Mongol,
that he was rejoiced that strangers, come from such a distance,
that Lamas of the Western Heaven, should deign to cast their eyes
upon his poor dwelling.&nbsp; Had he understood our European
idioms, our answer would have been: Pray don&rsquo;t mention it;
but as we had to speak in Mongol, <!-- page 36--><a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>we told him
that we had, indeed, come from a great distance, but that, in
great measure, we seemed once more at home, when we had the good
fortune to meet with hospitality such as his.&nbsp; After having
sipped the tea, and conversed for a while about France, Rome, the
Pope, and the cardinals, we got up, in order to visit the place
destined for us, which, for poor wanderers like us, seemed
perfectly magnificent.&nbsp; Our host assigned to us a large
room, with an ample kang, a separate kitchen, with stove, kettle,
and other utensils, and, lastly, a stable for the horse and the
mule.&nbsp; We almost wept with joy, and infinitely regretted
that we had not another Khata at hand, wherewith at once to
express our warm gratitude to the excellent Lama.</p>
<p>How potent is the empire of religion over the heart of man,
even though that religion be false, and ignorant of its true
object!&nbsp; How great was the difference, for example, between
these Lamas, so generous, so hospitable, so fraternal towards
strangers, and the Chinese, that thorough nation of shopkeepers,
with hearts dry as a ship-biscuit, and grasping as a monkey, who
will not give a traveller even a cup of water except for money or
money&rsquo;s worth.&nbsp; The reception given to us in the
Lamasery of Kounboum at once recalled to our thoughts those
monasteries, raised by the hospitality of our religious
ancestors, in which travellers and the poor ever found
refreshment for the body and consolation for the soul.</p>
<p>We moved into our new dwelling the same day, the Lamas, more
immediately neighbours of Sandara, cordially giving us their
assistance.&nbsp; It was obviously with genuine pleasure that
they carried for us, on their shoulders, the various articles
composing our baggage; that they swept the room, lighted the
fire, and arranged the stable for the reception of the
animals.&nbsp; When all these matters were completed, the master
of the house had, according to the rules of hospitality, to
prepare an entertainment for us, since people, who are moving,
are supposed to have no time for anything else.</p>
<p>Our readers will probably not be displeased at our giving them
here a sketch of our new house and of its inhabitants.&nbsp;
Immediately within the entrance gate was an oblong court,
surrounded with stables commodiously arranged.&nbsp; On the left
of the gate, a narrow passage led to a second square court, the
four sides of which were occupied with the cells of Lamas.&nbsp;
The side opposite the corridor constituted the abode of the
master of the house, named <i>Akay&eacute;</i> (old
brother.)&nbsp; Akay&eacute; was a man of sixty odd years, tall,
and so very thin and dry that he seemed a living skeleton.&nbsp;
His long face was a mere framework of bones, covered with a
baked, wrinkled skin.&nbsp; When he threw aside his scarf, and
showed his <!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>arms, blackened with the sun, you
might very well have taken them for two old bare vine
sticks.&nbsp; Though he still managed to keep himself tolerably
straight upon his legs, his step itself was tottering.&nbsp;
Altogether he looked like some antique piece of mechanism,
convulsively put in motion from time to time by the operation of
a piston.&nbsp; For thirty-eight years Akay&eacute; had been
employed in the temporal administration of the Lamasery.&nbsp; He
had in this occupation amassed a tolerable fortune, but it had
all gone in charitable gifts and in charity-loans never returned,
so that he was now reduced to great poverty, nothing remaining to
him but this house, which he had built in the time of his
prosperity, and which no one would purchase from him.&nbsp; To
let it was against the rules of the Lamasery, which admit no
medium between absolute sale or absolute gift, except gratuitous
loan.&nbsp; To complete his misfortunes, Akay&eacute; was unable
to profit by the extraordinary offerings which from time to time
are distributed among the Lamas who have attained certain grades
in the hierarchy.&nbsp; Having been completely occupied
throughout life with temporal matters, he had had no time for
study, so that he was altogether illiterate, and could neither
read nor write.&nbsp; This did not, however, prevent him from
praying, morning, noon, and night; he had his chaplet constantly
in his hand, and pass him when you might, you would hear him
mumbling various forms of prayer.&nbsp; This man was a creature
of excellent heart, but nobody seemed to take any heed to
him&mdash;he was old and penniless.</p>
<p>To the right of Akay&eacute;, in another side of the court,
lodged a Lama of Chinese origin, who was accordingly called the
<i>Kitat-Lama</i> (Chinese Lama).&nbsp; Though seventy years old,
he was in far better condition than poor Akay&eacute;; for though
his frame was somewhat bent, it was still comfortably filled out;
his face, replete with animation, was adorned with a fine white
beard, somewhat yellowish towards the extremity.&nbsp; The
Kitat-Lama was a man eminent among the Lama <i>savans</i>; he
wrote and spoke perfectly Chinese, Mongol, and Thibetian.&nbsp;
During a long residence in Thibet and in several kingdoms of
Tartary, he had amassed a large fortune; it was said that in his
cell were several chests full of silver ingots; yet his avarice
continued of the most sordid character; he lived wretchedly, and
clothed himself in rags; he was always turning his head about on
one side or the other, like a man in perpetual fear of being
robbed.&nbsp; In Tartary he had been considered a Grand Lama, but
in Kounboum, where Lamanesque notables abound, he was merely one
of the crowd.&nbsp; The Kitat-Lama had with him a <i>Chabi</i>
(pupil) eleven years old, a sharp, mischievous little vagabond,
though with a good heart at bottom.&nbsp; <!-- page 38--><a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>Every evening
we heard him at high words with his master, who regularly
reproached him at night for the monstrous extravagances of the
day, in respect of too much butter, too much tea, too much oil,
too much everything.</p>
<p>Opposite the dwelling of the Kitat-Lama was the lodging of the
two French missionaries; and beside their apartment was a small
cell, wherein modestly dwelt a young student of medicine, in his
second year.&nbsp; This young Lama was a tall, broad-shouldered
fellow of twenty-four, whose dull, lead-coloured, fat face
convicted him of effecting in his small abode a very considerable
consumption of butter.&nbsp; We never saw him poking his nose
from his hole without thinking of Fontaine&rsquo;s rat, which,
out of devotion, had retired into a great Dutch cheese.&nbsp;
This young man was afflicted with a convulsive stammering, which
sometimes almost choked him when he talked, and this infirmity,
in rendering him timid and reserved, had also, perhaps,
contributed to develop in him a certain amiability of manner and
readiness to oblige.&nbsp; His great horror was the little Chabi,
who took a malicious pleasure in imitating his manner of
speaking.</p>
<p>The portion of the court which faced the residence of old
Akay&eacute; was composed of a range of small kitchens, quite
separate the one from the other.&nbsp; The master of the house,
the Kitat-Lama, the stutterer, the missionaries, each had a
kitchen of his own.&nbsp; In the phrase of the Lamasery, we were
four distinct families in the house.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the
collection of several families within one enclosure, there
prevails throughout the most perfect order and silence; the
inmates seldom interchange visits, and each attends to his own
affairs without in the smallest degree interfering with those of
his neighbour.&nbsp; In the house where we were located, we never
saw our co-dwellers except on very fine days.&nbsp; It being now
the depth of winter, whenever the sun favoured our court-yard
with its rays, the four families forthwith issued from their
respective apartments, and sat themselves down before their doors
on their felt carpets.&nbsp; The Kitat-Lama, whose eyes were
still very good, would occupy himself in mending his wretched
garments with bits of old rags, Akay&eacute; would murmur his
prayers, scratching all the while his arms, the skin of which was
so rough that it almost resounded to the touch.&nbsp; The student
in medicine would chant, in order to avoid stammering, his lesson
of therapeutics.&nbsp; As to ourselves, it was no easy matter to
divert our attention from the singular spectacle around us; we
had, indeed, on our knees our book of Thibetian dialogues, but
our eyes were more frequently directed to the three families
basking in the sun.</p>
<p>The Lamasery of Kounboum contains nearly 4,000 Lamas; <!--
page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>its site is one of enchanting beauty.&nbsp; Imagine in a
mountain&rsquo;s side a deep, broad ravine, adorned with fine
trees, and harmonious with the cawing of rooks and yellow-beaked
crows, and the amusing chattering of magpies.&nbsp; On the two
sides of the ravine, and on the slopes of the mountain, rise, in
an amphitheatrical form, the white dwellings of the Lamas of
various sizes, but all alike surrounded with a wall, and
surmounted by a terrace.&nbsp; Amidst these modest habitations,
rich only in their intense cleanliness and their dazzling
whiteness, you see rising, here and there, numerous Buddhist
temples with gilt roofs, sparkling with a thousand brilliant
colours, and surrounded with elegant colonnades.&nbsp; The houses
of the superiors are distinguished by streamers floating from
small hexagonal turrets; everywhere the eye is attracted by
mystic sentences, written in large Thibetian characters, red or
black, upon the doors, upon the walls, upon the posts, upon
pieces of linen floating like flags, from masts upon the tops of
the houses.&nbsp; Almost at every step you see niches in form
resembling a sugar-loaf, within which are burning incense,
odoriferous wood, and cypress leaves.&nbsp; The most striking
feature of all, however, is to see an exclusive population of
Lamas walking about the numerous streets of the Lamasery, clothed
in their uniform of red dresses and yellow mitres.&nbsp; Their
face is ordinarily grave; and though silence is not prescribed,
they speak little, and that always in an under tone.&nbsp; You
see very few of them at all about the streets, except at the
hours appointed for entering or quitting the schools, and for
public prayer.&nbsp; During the rest of the day, the Lamas for
the most part keep within doors, except when they descend by
narrow, tortuous paths to the bottom of the ravines, and return
thence, laboriously carrying on their shoulders a long barrel
containing the water required for domestic purposes.&nbsp; At
intervals you meet strangers who come to satisfy a devotional
feeling, or to visit some Lama of their acquaintance.</p>
<p>The Lamasery of Kounboum, indeed, enjoys so high a reputation,
that the worshippers of Buddha resort thither in pilgrimage from
all parts of Tartary and Thibet, so that not a day passes in
which there are not pilgrims arriving and departing.&nbsp; Upon
the great festivals, the congregation of strangers is immense,
and there are four of these in the year, the most famous of all
being the Feast of Flowers, which takes place on the fifteenth
day of the first moon.&nbsp; Nowhere is this festival celebrated
with so much pomp and solemnity as at Kounboum.&nbsp; Those which
take place in Tartary, in Thibet, and even at Lha-Ssa itself, are
not at all comparable with it.&nbsp; We were installed at
Kounboum on the sixth of the first moon, and already numerous
caravans of pilgrims were arriving by every road that led to the
Lamasery.&nbsp; The festival was in every one&rsquo;s <!-- page
40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>mouth.&nbsp; The flowers, it was said, were this year of
surpassing beauty; the Council of the Fine Arts, who had examined
them, had declared them to be altogether superior to those of
preceding years.&nbsp; As soon as we heard of these marvellous
flowers, we hastened, as may be supposed, to seek information
respecting a festival hitherto quite unknown to us.&nbsp; The
following are the details with which we were furnished, and which
we heard with no little curiosity:&mdash;</p>
<p>The flowers of the fifteenth of the first moon consist of
representations, profane and religious, in which all the Asiatic
nations are introduced with their peculiar physiognomies and
their distinguishing costumes.&nbsp; Persons, places, apparel,
decorations&mdash;all are formed of fresh butter.&nbsp; Three
months are occupied in the preparations for this singular
spectacle.&nbsp; Twenty Lamas, selected from among the most
celebrated artists of the Lamasery, are daily engaged in these
butter-works, keeping their hands all the while in water, lest
the heat of the fingers should disfigure their productions.&nbsp;
As these labours take place chiefly in the depth of the winter,
the operators have much suffering to endure from the cold.&nbsp;
The first process is thoroughly to knead the butter, so as to
render it firm.&nbsp; When the material is thus prepared, the
various portions of the butter work are confided to various
artists, who, however, all alike work under the direction of a
principal who has furnished the plan of the flowers for the year,
and has the general superintendence of their production.&nbsp;
The figures, etc., being prepared and put together, are then
confided to another set of artists, who colour them, under the
direction of the same leader.&nbsp; A museum of works in butter
seemed to us so curious an idea, that we awaited the fifteenth of
the moon with somewhat of impatience.</p>
<p>On the eve of the festival, the arrival of strangers became
perfectly amazing.&nbsp; Kounboum was no longer the calm, silent
Lamasery, where everything bespoke the grave earnestness of
spiritual life, but a mundane city, full of bustle and
excitement.&nbsp; In every direction you heard the cries of the
camels and the bellowing of the long-haired oxen on which the
pilgrims had journeyed thither; on the slopes of the mountain
overlooking the Lamasery arose numerous tents wherein were
encamped such of the visitors as had not found accommodation in
the dwellings of the Lamas.&nbsp; Throughout the 14th, the number
of persons who performed the pilgrimage round the Lamasery was
immense.&nbsp; It was for us a strange and painful spectacle to
view that great crowd of human creatures prostrating themselves
at every step, and reciting in under tones their form of
prayer.&nbsp; There were among these Buddhist zealots a great
number of Tartar-Mongols, all coming from a great distance.&nbsp;
They were remarkable, alike, for their heavy, awkward gait, and
for <!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>the intense devotion and scrupulous application with
which they fulfilled the exact rules of the rite.&nbsp; The
Houng-Mao-Eul, or Long Hairs, were there too, and, their manners
being in no degree better here than at Tang-Keou-Eul, the haughty
uncouthness of their devotion presented a singular contrast with
the fervent, humble mysticism of the Mongols.&nbsp; They walked
proudly, with heads erect, the right arm out of the sleeve and
resting on their sabre hilts, and with fusils at their
backs.&nbsp; The Si-Fan of the Amdo country formed the majority
of the pilgrims.&nbsp; Their physiognomy expressed neither the
rough recklessness of the Long Hairs, nor the honest good faith
and good nature of the Tartars.&nbsp; They accomplished their
pilgrimage with an air of ease and nonchalance which seemed to
say, &ldquo;We are people of the place; we know all about the
matter, and need not put ourselves at all out of the
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The head-dress of the Amdo women occasioned us an agreeable
surprise; it was a little bonnet of black or grey felt, the form
of which was identical with that of the bonnets which were once
all the fashion in France, and which were called, if we remember
aright, <i>Chapeaux &agrave; la trois pour cent</i>.&nbsp; The
only difference was, that the riband by which the bonnet was tied
under the chin, instead of being black, was red or yellow.&nbsp;
The hair was allowed to fall from under the bonnet over the
shoulders, in a number of minute braids, decorated with
mother-of-pearl and coral beads.&nbsp; The rest of the costume
was like that of the Tartar women, the weighty effect of the
great sheepskin robe being, however, mightily modified by the
little <i>Chapeaux &agrave; la trois pour cent</i>, which
communicates a most coquettish air.&nbsp; We were greatly
surprised to find among the crowd of pilgrims several Chinese
who, chaplet in hand, were executing all the prostrations just
like the rest.&nbsp; Sandara the Bearded told us they were Khata
merchants, who, though they did not believe in Buddha at all,
pretended intense devotion to him, in order to conciliate custom
among his followers.&nbsp; We cannot say whether this was calumny
on Sandara&rsquo;s part; but certainly his representation
concurred altogether with our knowledge of the Chinese
character.</p>
<p>On the 15th, the pilgrims again made the circuit of the
Lamasery, but by no means in such numbers as on the preceding
days.&nbsp; Curiosity impelled the great majority rather towards
the points where preparations were making for the Feast of
Flowers.&nbsp; When night fell, Sandara came and invited us to go
and see the marvellous butter works of which we had heard so
much.&nbsp; We accordingly proceeded with him, accompanied by the
Stutterer, the Kitat-Lama, and the Chabi, leaving old
Akay&eacute; to take care of the house.&nbsp; The flowers were
arranged in the open air, before the various Buddhist <!-- page
42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>temples of the Lamasery, and displayed by illuminations
of the most dazzling brilliancy.&nbsp; Innumerable vases of brass
and copper, in the form of chalices, were placed upon slight
frame-work, itself representing various designs; and all these
vases were filled with thick butter, supporting a solid
wick.&nbsp; The illuminations were arranged with a taste that
would have reflected no discredit on a Parisian decorator.</p>
<p>The appearance of the flowers themselves quite amazed
us.&nbsp; We could never have conceived that in these deserts,
amongst a half savage people, artists of such eminent merit could
have been found.&nbsp; From the paintings and sculptures we had
seen in various Lamaseries, we had not in the slightest degree
been led to anticipate the exquisite finish which we had occasion
to admire in the butter works.&nbsp; The flowers were
bas-reliefs, of colossal proportions, representing various
subjects taken from the history of Buddhism.&nbsp; All the
personages were invested with a truth of expression that quite
surprised us.&nbsp; The features were full of life and animation,
the attitudes natural, and the drapery easy and graceful.&nbsp;
You could distinguish at a glance the nature and quality of the
materials represented.&nbsp; The furs were especially good.&nbsp;
The various skins of the sheep, the tiger, the fox, the wolf,
etc., were so admirably rendered, that you felt inclined to go
and feel them with the hand, and ascertain whether, after all,
they were not real.&nbsp; In each bas-relief you at once
recognised Buddha, his face, full of nobleness and majesty,
appertained to the Caucasian type; the artists conforming therein
to the Buddhist traditions, which relate that Buddha, a native of
the Western Heaven, had a complexion fair, and slightly tinged
with red, broad, full eyes, a large nose, and long, curling, soft
hair.&nbsp; The other personages had all the Mongol type, with
the Thibetian, Chinese, Si-Fan, and Tartar shadings, so nicely
discriminated that, without any reference whatever to the
costume, you recognised at once to what particular tribe each
individual belonged.&nbsp; There were a few heads of Hindoos and
negroes, excellently represented.&nbsp; The latter excited a good
deal of curiosity among the spectators.&nbsp; These large
bas-reliefs were surrounded with frames, representing animals and
flowers, all in butter, and all admirable, like the works they
enclosed, for their delicacy of outline and the beauty of their
colouring.&nbsp; On the road which led from one temple to
another, were placed, at intervals, small bas-reliefs
representing, in miniature, battles, hunting incidents, nomadic
episodes, and views of the most celebrated Lamaseries of Thibet
and Tartary.&nbsp; Finally, in front of the principal temple,
there was a theatre, which, with its personages and its
decorations, were all of butter.&nbsp; The <i>dramatis
person&aelig;</i> were a foot high, and represented a community
of <!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>Lamas on their way to solemnize prayer.&nbsp; At first,
the stage is empty, then, a marine conch is sounded, and you see
issuing from two doors, two files of minor Lamas, followed by the
superiors in their state dresses.&nbsp; After remaining, for a
moment, motionless on the stage, the procession disappears at the
sides, and the representation is over.&nbsp; This spectacle
excited general enthusiasm; but, for ourselves, who had seen
rather better mechanism, we regarded these mannikins, that moved
on the stage and then moved off it without stirring a limb, as
decidedly flat.&nbsp; One representation of the play, therefore,
amply sufficed for us, and we went about admiring the
bas-reliefs.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Whilst we were examining a group of devils, as grotesque, at
all events, as those of Callot, we heard behind us a tremendous
flourish of trumpets and marine conchs, and, upon inquiry, were
informed that the Grand Lama was issuing forth from his sanctuary
<!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>to visit the flowers.&nbsp; We desired nothing better,
for the Grand Lama of Kounboum was a great object of curiosity
with us.&nbsp; He soon reached the place where we stood.&nbsp; He
walked in the centre of the principal dignitaries of the
Lamasery, preceded by minor Lamas, who cleared the way with great
black whips.&nbsp; This Living Buddha appeared to us to be, at
the outside, forty years old, he was of ordinary size, with a
very flat and very common face, and of a very dark
complexion.&nbsp; As he passed on he gave a vague glance at the
bas-reliefs; when he saw that fine face of Buddha so repeatedly
presented to his observation, he must, we thought, have said to
himself that by dint of transmigrations he had dolefully
degenerated from his original type.&nbsp; If the person of the
Grand Lama, however, did not particularly strike us, his costume
did, for it was strictly that of our own bishops: he bore on his
head a yellow mitre, a long staff in the form of a cross was in
his right hand, and his shoulders were covered with a mantle of
purple coloured silk, fastened on the chest with a clasp, and in
every respect resembling a cope.&nbsp; Hereafter we shall have
occasion to point out numerous analogies between the Roman
Catholic worship and the Lamanesque ceremonies.</p>
<p>The spectators generally appeared to give very slight heed to
their Living Buddha, their attention being much more closely
applied to the Buddhas in butter, which, in truth, were much
better worth looking at.&nbsp; The Tartars alone manifested any
tokens of devotion; they clasped their hands, bowed their heads
in token of respect, and seemed quite afflicted that the pressure
of the crowd prevented them from prostrating themselves at full
length.</p>
<p>When the Grand Lama had made his circuit, he returned to his
sanctuary, a proceeding which was adopted by all the spectators
as a signal for abandoning themselves without reserve to
transports of the most frantic joy.&nbsp; They sang themselves
out of breath, they danced themselves out of breath, they pushed
one another about, they shouted and bawled loud enough to
frighten the desert itself, they seemed all at once to have
become a collection of lunatics.&nbsp; As, with all this
disorder, there was risk of the illuminations and the butter
works being overturned, Lamas armed with great lighted torches
were stationed, at intervals, to stay the waves of the immense
mass that rolled to and fro like a sea beaten by the
tempest.&nbsp; We could not long endure the pressure, and the
Kitat-Lama, perceiving the oppression under which we laboured,
invited us to return home.&nbsp; We adopted the proposition all
the more readily, that the night was far advanced, and we felt
the need of repose.</p>
<p>Next morning, when the sun rose, not a trace remained of the
Feast of Flowers.&nbsp; All had disappeared; the bas-reliefs bad
been <!-- page 45--><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>demolished, and the immense collection of butter had
been thrown down a ravine to feed the crows withal.&nbsp; These
grand works, on which so much pains, so much time, we may also
say, so much genius had been expended, had served merely as a
spectacle for a single evening.&nbsp; Every year they make new
flowers, and every year upon a new plan.</p>
<p>With the flowers disappeared also the pilgrims.&nbsp; Already,
at daybreak, you saw them slowly ascending the tortuous paths of
the mountain, returning to their homes in the desert sorrowfully
and silently; for the heart of man can endure so little of joy in
this world that the day succeeding a festival is generally full
of bitterness and melancholy.</p>

<p>The country of Amdo, situate south of Koukou-Noor, is
inhabited by Eastern Thibetians, who, like the Mongol Tartars,
lead a pastoral and nomadic life.&nbsp; The aspect of the country
is wild and dismal.&nbsp; In all directions the eye discerns
nothing but mountains of red and yellow ochre, almost destitute
of vegetation, and intersected by deep ravines.&nbsp; It is only
here and there, in this sterile and desolate region, that you
find valleys tolerably supplied with pasturage, and hither the
nomad tribes lead their flocks.</p>
<p>According to the Lamanesque chronicles, towards the middle of
the fourteenth century of our era, a shepherd of the land of
Amdo, <!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>named Lombo-Moke, had set up his
black tent at the foot of a mountain, near the entrance to a deep
ravine, through which, over a rocky bed, meandered an abundant
stream.&nbsp; Lombo-Moke shared with his wife, Chingtsa-Tsio, the
cares of pastoral life.&nbsp; They possessed no numerous flocks;
some twenty goats and a few sarligues or long-haired cattle,
constituted all their wealth.&nbsp; For many years they had lived
alone and childless in these wild solitudes.&nbsp; Each day
Lombo-Moke led his animals to the neighbouring pastures, while
Chingtsa-Tsio, remaining alone in her tent, occupied herself with
the various preparations of milk, or with weaving, after the
manner of the women of Amdo, a coarse linen with the long hair of
the sarligues.</p>
<p>One day, Chingtsa-Tsio having descended to the bottom of the
ravine to draw water, experienced a faintness, and fell senseless
on a large stone which bore inscribed on it various characters in
honour of the Buddha Chakdja-Mouni.&nbsp; When Chingtsa-Tsio came
to herself, she felt a pain in the side, and at once comprehended
that the fall had rendered her fruitful.&nbsp; In the year of the
Fire Hen (1357), nine months after this mysterious event, she
brought into the world a son, whom Lombo-Moke named Tsong-Kaba,
from the appellation of the mountain, at whose feet his tent had
stood for several years past.&nbsp; The marvellous child had, at
his birth, a white beard, and his face wore an air of
extraordinary majesty.&nbsp; There was nothing childlike about
his manners.&nbsp; So soon as he saw the light, he was capable of
expressing himself with clearness and precision in the language
of Amdo.&nbsp; He spoke little, indeed, but his words always
developed a profound appreciation of the nature and destiny of
man.</p>
<p>At the age of three, Tsong-Kaba resolved to renounce the
world, and to embrace the religious life.&nbsp; Chingtsa-Tsio,
full of respect for the holy project of her son, herself shaved
his head, and threw his fine long flowing hair outside the
tent.&nbsp; From this hair, there forthwith sprung a tree, the
wood of which dispensed an exquisite perfume around, and each
leaf of which bore, engraved on its surface, a character in the
sacred language of Thibet.&nbsp; Tsong-Kaba himself withdrew into
the most absolute retirement, avoiding even the presence of his
parents.&nbsp; He took up his position on the summits of the
wildest mountains, or in the depths of the profoundest ravines,
and there passed whole days and nights in prayer and in the
contemplation of eternal things.&nbsp; His fastings were long and
frequent.&nbsp; He respected the life even of the humblest
insect, and rigorously interdicted himself the consumption of any
sort of flesh whatever.</p>
<p>While Tsong-Kaba was thus engaged in purifying his heart by
<!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>assiduity and prayer, and the practices of an austere
life, a Lama, from one of the most remote regions of the West,
casually visited the land of Amdo, and received the hospitality
of Lombo-Moke&rsquo;s tent.&nbsp; Tsong-Kaba, amazed at the
science and the sanctity of the stranger, prostrated himself at
his feet, and conjured him to become his instructor.&nbsp; The
Lamanesque traditions relate that this Lama of the western
regions was remarkable not only for his learning, the profundity
of which was unfathomable, but for the singularity of his
appearance.&nbsp; People especially remarked his great nose, and
his eyes that gleamed as with a supernatural fire.&nbsp; The
stranger being, on his part, not less struck with the marvellous
qualities of Tsong-Kaba, did not hesitate to adopt him as his
disciple, and for this purpose took up his abode in the land of
Amdo, where, however, he only lived a few years.&nbsp; After
having initiated his pupil in all the doctrines recognised by the
most renowned saints of the West, he fell asleep one day, on a
stone, on the summit of a mountain, and his eyes opened not
again.</p>
<p>Tsong-Kaba, deprived of the holy stranger&rsquo;s lessons,
became all the more eager for religious instruction, and ere long
he formed the resolution of abandoning his tribe, and of going to
the further west, to drink at their very source the pure precepts
of sacred science.&nbsp; He departed, staff in hand, alone, and
without a guide, but his heart filled with superhuman
courage.&nbsp; He first proceeded due south, and reached, after
long and laborious journeying, the frontiers of the province of
Yun-Nan, quite at the extremity of the Chinese empire.&nbsp;
Then, instead of pursuing the previous direction, he turned
towards the north-west, along the banks of the great river
Yarou-Dsangbo.&nbsp; He reached, at length, the sacred town of
the kingdom of Oui. <a name="citation48"></a><a
href="#footnote48" class="citation">[48]</a>&nbsp; As he was
about to continue on his way, a <i>Lha</i> (spirit), all radiant
with light, stayed him, and prohibited his further
progress.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, Tsong-Kaba,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;all
these vast regions belong to the great empire which has been
granted to thee.&nbsp; It is here thou art ordained to promulgate
the rites of religion and its prayers.&nbsp; It is here will be
accomplished the last evolution of thy immortal
life.&rdquo;&nbsp; Tsong-Kaba, docile to the supernatural voice,
entered the <i>Land of Spirits</i> (Lha-Ssa), and selected an
humble dwelling, in the most solitary quarter of the town.</p>
<p>The monk of the tribe of Amdo soon attracted disciples; and
before long, his new doctrine and the innovations which he
introduced into the Lamanesque ceremonies, created considerable
<!-- page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>excitement.&nbsp; At length, Tsong-Kaba resolutely put
himself forward as a reformer, and began to make war upon the
ancient worship.&nbsp; His partisans increased from day to day,
and became known as the Yellow Cap Lamas, in contradistinction to
the Red Cap Lamas, who supported the old system.&nbsp; The king
of the country of Oui, and the Chakdja, the Living Buddha, and
chief of the local Lamanesque hierarchy, became alarmed at this
new sect that was introducing confusion into religious
ceremonies.&nbsp; The Chakdja sent for Tsong-Kaba, in order to
ascertain whether his knowledge was so profound, so marvellous,
as his partisans pretended; but the reformer refused to accept
the invitation.&nbsp; Representing a religious system which was
to supersede the old system, it was not his business, he
considered, to perform an act of submission.</p>
<p>Meantime the Yellow Caps became, by degrees, the predominant
sect, and the homage of the multitude was turned towards
Tsong-Kaba.&nbsp; The Buddha Chakdja, finding his authority
repudiated, made up his mind to go and visit the little Lama of
the province of Amdo, as he contumeliously designated the
reformer.&nbsp; At this interview, he proposed to have a
discussion with his adversary, which he flattered himself would
result in the triumph of the old doctrine.&nbsp; He repaired to
the meeting with great pomp, surrounded with all the attributes
of his religious supremacy.&nbsp; As he entered the modest cell
of Tsong-Kaba, his high red cap struck against the beam of the
door, and fell to the ground, an accident which everybody
regarded as a presage of triumph for the Yellow Cap.&nbsp; The
reformer was seated on a cushion, his legs crossed, and
apparently took no heed to the entrance of the Chakdja.&nbsp; He
did not rise to receive him, but continued gravely to tell his
beads.&nbsp; The Chakdja, without permitting himself to be
disconcerted either by the fall of his cap, or by the cold
reception that was given him, entered abruptly upon the
discussion, by a pompous eulogium of the old rites, and an
enumeration of the privileges which he claimed under them.&nbsp;
Tsong-Kaba, without raising his eyes, interrupted him in these
terms: &ldquo;Let go, cruel man that thou art, let go the louse
thou art crushing between thy fingers.&nbsp; I hear its cries
from where I sit, and my heart is torn with commiserating
grief.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Chakdja, in point of fact, while vaunting
his own virtues, had seized a louse under his vest, and in
contempt of the doctrine of transmigration, which forbids men to
kill anything that has life in it, he was endeavouring to crack
it between his nails.&nbsp; Unprovided with a reply to the severe
words of Tsong-Kaba, he prostrated himself at his feet, and
acknowledged his supremacy.</p>
<p>Thenceforward, the reforms proposed by Tsong-Kaba encountered
no obstacle; they were adopted throughout Thibet, and afterwards
<!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>became, by imperceptible degrees, established in all the
kingdoms of Tartary.&nbsp; In 1409, Tsong-Kaba, then 52 years
old, founded the celebrated monastery of Kaldan, three leagues
from Lha-Ssa; it still flourishes, containing upwards of 8,000
Lamas.&nbsp; In 1419, the soul of Tsong-Kaba, who had become
Buddha, quitted the earth and returned to the Celestial Realm,
where it was admitted into the Heaven of Rapture.&nbsp; His body,
which remained in the Lamasery of Kaldan, preserves to this day,
it is alleged, all its original freshness, and, moreover, by a
perennial miracle, lies a little above the earth, without being
supported or raised upon anything.&nbsp; It is added, that the
mouth still, from time to time, addresses words of encouragement
to those Lamas who have made marked progress towards
perfection&mdash;words altogether inaudible for the less eminent
of the community.</p>
<p>Besides the reformation which Tsong-Kaba introduced into the
liturgy, he rendered himself further famous by a new edition of
the &ldquo;Body of Doctrine,&rdquo; left by Chakdja-Mouni.&nbsp;
The most important of his other works is entitled
<i>Lam-Rim-Tsien-Bo</i> (the Progressive Path to Perfection).</p>
<p>Upon the most superficial examination of the reforms and
innovations introduced by Tsong-Kaba into the Lamanesque worship,
one must be struck with their affinity to Catholicism.&nbsp; The
cross, the mitre, the dalmatica, the cope, which the Grand Lamas
wear on their journeys, or when they are performing some ceremony
out of the temple, the service with double choirs, the psalmody,
the exorcisms, the censer, suspended from five chains, and which
you can open or close at pleasure; the benedictions given by the
Lamas by extending the right hand over the heads of the faithful;
the chaplet, ecclesiastical celibacy, spiritual retirement, the
worship of the saints, the fasts, the processions, the litanies,
the holy water, all these are analogies between the Buddhists and
ourselves.&nbsp; Now, can it be said that these analogies are of
Christian origin?&nbsp; We think so.&nbsp; We have indeed found,
neither in the traditions nor in the monuments of the country,
any positive proof of their adoption, still it is perfectly
legitimate to put forward conjectures which possess all the
characteristics of the most emphatic probability.</p>
<p>It is known that, in the fourteenth century, at the time of
the domination of the Mongol emperors, there existed frequent
relations between the Europeans and the peoples of Upper
Asia.&nbsp; We have already, in the former part of our narrative,
referred to those celebrated embassies which the Tartar
conquerors sent to Rome, to France, and to England.&nbsp; There
is no doubt that the barbarians who thus visited Europe must have
been struck with the pomp and splendour of the ceremonies of
Catholic worship, and must have <!-- page 51--><a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>carried back
with them into the desert enduring memories of what they had
seen.&nbsp; On the other hand, it is also known that, at the same
period, brethren of various religious orders undertook remote
pilgrimages for the purpose of introducing Christianity into
Tartary; and these must have penetrated at the same time into
Thibet, among the Si-Fan, and among the Mongols on the Blue
Sea.&nbsp; Jean de Montcorvin, Archbishop of Peking, had already
organized a choir of Mongol monks, who daily practised the
recitation of the psalms, and the ceremonies of the Catholic
faith.&nbsp; Now, if one reflects that Tsong-Kaba lived precisely
at the period when the Christian religion was being introduced
into Central Asia, it will be no longer matter of astonishment
that we find, in reformed Buddhism, such striking analogies with
Christianity.</p>
<p>And may we not proceed to lay down a proposition of a more
positive character?&nbsp; This very legend of Tsong-Kaba, which
we heard in the very place of his birth, and from the mouth of
several Lamas, does it not materially strengthen our
theory?&nbsp; Setting aside all the marvellous features which
have been added to the story by the imagination of the Lamas, it
may be fairly admitted that Tsong-Kaba was a man raised above the
ordinary level by his genius, and also, perhaps, by his virtue;
that he was instructed by a stranger from the West; that after
the death of the master the disciple, proceeding to the West,
took up his abode in Thibet, where he diffused the instruction
which he himself had received.&nbsp; May it not be reasonably
inferred that this stranger with the great nose was an European,
one of those Catholic missionaries who at the precise period
penetrated in such numbers into Upper Asia.&nbsp; It is by no
means surprising that the Lamanesque traditions should have
preserved the memory of that European face, whose type is so
different from that of the Asiatics.&nbsp; During our abode at
Kounboum, we, more than once, heard the Lamas make remarks upon
the singularity of our features, and say, roundly, that we were
of the same land with the master of Tsong-Kaba.&nbsp; It may be
further supposed that a premature death did not permit the
Catholic missionary to complete the religious education of his
disciple, who himself, when afterwards he became an apostle,
merely applied himself, whether from having acquired only an
incomplete knowledge of Christian doctrine, or from having
apostatized from it, to the introduction of a new Buddhist
Liturgy.&nbsp; The feeble opposition which he encountered in his
reformation, would seem to indicate that already the progress of
Christian ideas in these countries had materially shaken the
faith of Buddha.&nbsp; We shall by-and-by inquire whether the
numerous analogies between the Buddhists and the Catholics are an
obstacle or an aid to the propagation of the faith in Tartary and
Thibet.</p>
<p><!-- page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>The reformation of Tsong-Kaba triumphed in all the
regions comprised between the Himalaya mountains, the frontiers
of Russia, and the Great Wall of China.&nbsp; It even made its
way into some provinces of the Celestial Empire, into Kan Sou,
for example, Chan-Si, Petche-Li, and all Mantchouria.&nbsp; The
bonzes have retained the ancient rites, with the exception only
of a few innovations which have been adopted in particular
localities.&nbsp; There is now a regular distinction understood
between the two classes of Lamas, the yellow and the grey; that
is to say, those who follow the reformation and those who persist
in the elder worship.&nbsp; These two sects, which no doubt at
one time treated each other as rivals, and made war upon each
other, now live in perfect harmony.&nbsp; The Bonzes and the
Lamas regard themselves as all of the same family.</p>
<p>The tribe of Amdo, previously altogether obscure and of no
importance whatever, has, since the reformation of Buddhism,
acquired a prodigious celebrity.&nbsp; The mountain at the foot
of which Tsong-Kaba was born, became a famous place of
pilgrimage.&nbsp; Lamas assembled there from all parts to build
their cells, and thus by degrees was formed that flourishing
Lamasery, the fame of which extends to the remotest confines of
Tartary.&nbsp; It is called Kounboum, from two Thibetian words
signifying Ten Thousand Images, and having allusion to the tree
which, according to the legend, sprang from Tsong-Kaba&rsquo;s
hair, and bears a Thibetian character on each of its leaves.</p>
<p>It will here be naturally expected that we say something about
this tree itself.&nbsp; Does it exist?&nbsp; Have we seen
it?&nbsp; Has it any peculiar attributes?&nbsp; What about its
marvellous leaves?&nbsp; All these questions our readers are
entitled to put to us.&nbsp; We will endeavour to answer as
categorically as possible.</p>
<p>Yes, this tree does exist, and we had heard of it too often
during our journey not to feel somewhat eager to visit it.&nbsp;
At the foot of the mountain on which the Lamasery stands, and not
far from the principal Buddhist temple, is a great square
enclosure, formed by brick walls.&nbsp; Upon entering this we
were able to examine at leisure the marvellous tree, some of the
branches of which had already manifested themselves above the
wall.&nbsp; Our eyes were first directed with earliest curiosity
to the leaves, and we were filled with an absolute consternation
of astonishment at finding that, in point of fact, there were
upon each of the leaves well-formed Thibetian characters, all of
a green colour, some darker, some lighter than the leaf
itself.&nbsp; Our first impression was a suspicion of fraud on
the part of the Lamas; but, after a minute examination of every
detail, we could not discover the least deception.&nbsp; The
characters all appeared to us portions of the leaf itself,
equally with its veins <!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>and nerves; the position was not the
same in all; in one leaf they would be at the top of the leaf; in
another, in the middle; in a third, at the base, or at the side;
the younger leaves represented the characters only in a partial
state of formation.&nbsp; The bark of the tree and its branches,
which resemble that of the plane tree, are also covered with
these characters.&nbsp; When you remove a piece 
<a href="images/p53.jpg">
<img class='clearcenter' alt=
"The Tree of Ten Thousand Images"
title=
"The Tree of Ten Thousand Images"
src="images/p53.jpg" />
</a> of old bark, the young bark under it exhibits the indistinct
outlines of characters in a germinating state, and, what is very
singular, these new characters are not unfrequently different
from those which they replace.&nbsp; We examined everything with
the closest attention, in order to detect some trace of trickery,
but we could discern nothing of the sort, and the perspiration
absolutely trickled down our faces under the influence of the
sensations which this <!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>most amazing spectacle created.&nbsp;
More profound intellects than ours may, perhaps, be able to
supply a satisfactory explanation of the mysteries of this
singular tree; but as to us, we altogether give it up.&nbsp; Our
readers possibly may smile at our ignorance; but we care not, so
that the sincerity and truth of our statement be not
suspected.</p>
<p>The Tree of the Ten Thousand Images seemed to us of great
age.&nbsp; Its trunk, which three men could scarcely embrace with
outstretched arms, is not more than eight feet high; the
branches, instead of shooting up, spread out in the shape of a
plume of feathers, and are extremely bushy; few of them are
dead.&nbsp; The leaves are always green, and the wood, which is
of a reddish tint, has an exquisite odour, something like that of
cinnamon.&nbsp; The Lamas informed us that in summer, towards the
eighth moon, the tree produces large red flowers of an extremely
beautiful character.&nbsp; They informed us also that there
nowhere else exists another such tree; that many attempts have
been made in various Lamaseries of Tartary and Thibet to
propagate it by seeds and cuttings, but that all these attempts
have been fruitless.</p>
<p>The Emperor Khang-Hi, when upon a pilgrimage to Kounboum,
constructed, at his own private expense, a dome of silver over
the Tree of the Ten Thousand Images; moreover, he made a present
to the Grand Lama of a fine black horse, capable of travelling a
thousand lis a day, and of a saddle adorned with precious
stones.&nbsp; The horse is dead, but the saddle is still shown in
one of the Buddhist temples, where it is an object of special
veneration.&nbsp; Before quitting the Lamasery, Khang-Hi endowed
it with a yearly revenue, for the support of 350 Lamas.</p>
<p>The fame of Kounboum, due in the first instance to the
celebrity of Tsong-Kaba, is now maintained by the excellent
discipline of the Lamasery, and the superiority of its
teaching.&nbsp; Its Lamas are deemed students throughout their
lives, for religious knowledge is reputed inexhaustible.&nbsp;
The students are distributed into four sections, or faculties,
according to the nature of the special studies to which they
desire to apply themselves.&nbsp; 1. The Faculty of Mysticism,
which comprehends the rules of contemplative life, and the
examples exhibited in the career of the Buddhist saints.&nbsp; 2.
The Faculty of Liturgy, comprising the study of religious
ceremonies, with the expounding of all that appertains to
Lamanesque worship.&nbsp; 3. The Faculty of Medicine, which
applies itself to the four hundred and forty maladies of the
human frame, to medical botany, and to the
pharmacop&oelig;ia.&nbsp; 4. The Faculty of Prayers, the most
esteemed of all, the best paid, and, as a matter of course, the
most numerous.</p>
<p><!-- page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>The voluminous works which serve as the basis of
instruction in prayers, are divided into thirteen series, which
represent, as it were, so many degrees in the hierarchy.&nbsp;
The place which each student occupies in the schoolroom and the
temple service, depends upon the series of theological works
through which he has passed.&nbsp; Among the Lamas, you see old
men proclaiming, by their low position in the hierarchy, their
idleness or incapacity; and, on the other hand, mere youths
elevated, by their application and their ability, to the highest
ranks.</p>
<p>In order to obtain a degree in the Faculty of Prayers, all
that is required from the student is to recite, without stopping,
the books he has been directed to study.&nbsp; When he believes
himself quite up, he gives intimation of this belief to the Grand
Lama of prayers, in the form of a rich khata, a dish of raisins,
and some ounces of silver, in ingots, the amount depending upon
the degree at which he aims; he also makes presents to the Lama
examiners.&nbsp; Although it is, of course, perfectly understood
that the judges are incorruptible, yet at Kounboum, as elsewhere,
people do say that a few offerings to the academy are not without
their effect at an examination.&nbsp; Men are men everywhere!</p>
<p>Before the principal temple of the Lamasery, there is a large
square court, paved with broad stones, and surrounded with
twisted columns, covered with coloured sculptures.&nbsp; It is in
this enclosure that the Lamas of the Faculty of Prayers assemble
at the lecture hour, which is announced to them by the sound of a
marine conch; here they sit, according to their rank, upon the
bare stones, undergoing, in winter, the cold, the frost, and the
snow; and in summer, the rain and the sun&rsquo;s heat.&nbsp; The
professors alone are under shelter; they sit upon a sort of
platform, covered with a tent.&nbsp; It is a singular spectacle
to see all these Lamas with their red scarfs and great yellow
mitres, so huddled together that you cannot see the flagstones on
which they sit.&nbsp; After some of the students have given out
the lesson of the day, the professors, in turn, give
commentaries, vague and incomprehensible as the text itself, but
nobody makes any objection; the explanation is quite near
enough.&nbsp; Besides, the universal conviction is that the
sublimity of a doctrine is in exact proportion to its obscurity
and its unintelligibility.</p>
<p>The lesson generally concludes with a thesis, supported by a
student previously named for that purpose, and whom the other
students are entitled to question, upon whatever subject comes
into their heads at the time.&nbsp; There is nothing more
preposterous than these theses, which nearly remind one of those
famous discussions of the schools in the middle ages, where there
were such furious argumentations <i>de omni re scibili</i>.&nbsp;
At Kounboum the rule is for <!-- page 56--><a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>the conqueror
to mount on the shoulders of the conquered, and to be carried by
him in triumph right round the walls of the school.&nbsp; One day
Sandara the Bearded came home from lecture, his face radiant with
unwonted smiles.&nbsp; We soon learned that he had been the hero
of the theses: he had defeated his competitor upon the important
question why poultry and other winged creatures are destitute of
one of the vital functions common to all other animals.&nbsp; We
mention this particular instance, because it will give an idea of
the elevation and grandeur of Lamanesque education.</p>
<p>At certain periods of the year, the Living Buddha, the Grand
Superior of the Lamasery, himself appears in person, and gives,
in state, official expoundings of the Sacred Books.&nbsp; These
commentaries, though not a bit more learned or more lucid than
those of the professors, are received as authority.&nbsp; The
Thibetian language is alone used in the schools.</p>
<p>The discipline of the Lamasery is vigilant and severe.&nbsp;
In the Faculties, during the lectures, and in the temples, during
the recitation of prayers, you see Lama censors leaning upon long
iron rods, and maintaining order and silence among the
students.&nbsp; The least infraction of the rules is at once
visited with a reprimand and, if necessary, with blows of the
iron rod, the old Lamas being equally liable to both the one and
the other, with the young Chabis.</p>
<p>A certain number of Lamas form the police of the Lamasery;
they are attired in the same manner as the other Lamas, only
their dress is grey, and their mitre black.&nbsp; Day and night
they perambulate the streets of the city, armed with a great
whip, and re-establish order wherever their interposition has
become necessary.&nbsp; Three tribunals, presided over by Lama
judges, have jurisdiction in all matters that are above the
immediate authority of the police.&nbsp; Those who are guilty of
theft, to however trifling an amount, are first branded on the
forehead and on each cheek with a hot on, and then expelled from
the Lamasery.</p>
<p>The Buddhist monasteries, though similar in many respects to
our own, exhibit essential differences.&nbsp; The Lamas are
subject, it is true, to one same rule, and to one same
discipline, but it cannot be said that they live in
community.&nbsp; You find among them all the graduated shades of
poverty and wealth that you see in mundane cities.&nbsp; At
Kounboum we often observed Lamas clothed in rags, begging, at the
doors of their rich brethren, a few handfuls of barley
meal.&nbsp; Every third month the authorities make a distribution
of meal to all the Lamas of the Lamaseries, without distinction,
but the quantity is altogether inadequate.&nbsp; The voluntary
offerings of the pilgrims come in aid, but, besides that these
offerings are uncertain, they are divided among the Lamas
according to <!-- page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>the position which each occupies in
the hierarchy, so that there are always a great many who never
receive any thing at all from this source.</p>
<p>Offerings are of two sorts, tea offerings and money
offerings.&nbsp; The first is operated in this fashion: the
pilgrim who proposes to entertain the brotherhood, waits upon the
superiors of the Lamasery, and, presenting to them a khata,
announces that he shall have the devotion to offer to the Lamas a
general or special tea.&nbsp; The tea-general is for the whole
Lamasery without distinction; the tea-special is given only to
one of the four faculties, the selection being with the
pilgrim.&nbsp; On the day filed for a tea-general, after the
repetition of morning prayer, the presiding Lama gives a signal
for the company to retain their seats.&nbsp; Then forty young
Chabis, appointed by lot, proceed to the great kitchen, and soon
return, laden with jars of tea with milk; they pass along the
ranks, and as they come to each Lama, the latter draws from his
bosom his wooden tea-cup, and it is filled to the brim.&nbsp;
Each drinks in silence, carefully placing a corner of his scarf
before his cup, in order to modify the apparent anomaly of
introducing so material a proceeding as tea-drinking into so
spiritual a spot.&nbsp; Generally there is tea enough presented
to go round twice, the tea being stronger or weaker according to
the generosity of the donor.&nbsp; There are some pilgrims who
add a slice of fresh butter for each Lama, and magnificent
Amphytrions go the length, further, of oatmeal cakes.&nbsp; When
the banquet is over, the presiding Lama solemnly proclaims the
name of the pious pilgrim, who has done himself the immense
credit of regaling the holy family of Lamas; the pilgrim donor
prostrates himself on the earth; the Lamas sing a hymn in his
favour, and then march out in procession past their prostrate
benefactor, who does not rise until the last of the Lamas has
disappeared.</p>
<p>Offerings of this sort are very little for each individual
Lama; but when you reflect that on such occasions there are
assembled together more than 4,000 tea-drinkers, you may easily
estimate that the aggregate expense becomes a very serious
affair.&nbsp; In the Lamasery at Kounboum, one single
tea-general, without either butter or cakes, costs fifty ounces
of silver, or about twenty pounds.</p>
<p>Money offerings are still more expensive, for they are always
accompanied with a tea-general.&nbsp; The money is not
distributed at service time.&nbsp; After prayers, the presiding
Lama announces that such a pilgrim, of such a place, has offered
so many ounces of silver to the holy family of Lamas, and that
the whole sum equally divided produces such a quotient.&nbsp; In
the course of the day, the Lamas proceed to the Offering-office,
where their respective proportion is scrupulously delivered to
them.</p>
<p><!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>There is no particular period or day fixed for the
reception of offerings: they are always welcome; however, at the
four great festivals of the year, they are more numerous and more
important than at other times, on account of the greater number
of pilgrims.&nbsp; After the Feast of Flowers, the King of
Souniout, who was at Kounboum, made an offering, before he
returned into Tartary, of six hundred ounces of silver, and a
tea-general for eight days! with butter and cakes; the total
expense amounted to six hundred pounds!&nbsp; When the offering
is made by a distinguished personage, it is customary for the
Living Buddha to be present at the ceremony, and he receives for
his especial share an ingot of silver weighing fifty ounces, a
piece of red or yellow silk, a pair of boots, and a mitre,
arranged in a basket decorated with flowers and ribands, and
covered with a rich khata.&nbsp; The pilgrim prostrates himself
on the steps of the altar, where the Living Buddha is seated, and
places the basket at his feet.&nbsp; A Chabi takes it up, and in
return, presents to the pilgrim a khata in the name of the Living
Buddha, whose business throughout is to preserve the
impassibility and dignity befitting his assumed divinity.</p>
<p>Besides the distributions and the offerings the Lamas of
Kounboum employ various means of improving their temporal
condition.&nbsp; Some of them keep cows, and sell to their
colleagues the milk and butter which help to season their tea and
oatmeal.&nbsp; Others form themselves into a joint stock company,
and undertake the preparation of the teas-general which the
pilgrims present to the community: others are tailors, dyers,
bootmakers, hatters, and so on, and make up, for a fixed
remuneration, the clothes of the Lamas.&nbsp; Lastly, a few of
the number have shops, wherein they sell, at enormous profit,
various goods, which they procure from Tang-Keou-Eul or
Si-Ning-Fou.</p>
<p>In the class of industrial Lamas there is, however, a certain
number who derive their livelihood from occupations which seem
more comformable with the spirit of a religious life, namely, the
printing and transcribing the Lamanesque books.&nbsp; Our readers
are, perhaps, aware that the Thibetian writing proceeds
horizontally, and from left to right.&nbsp; Though the idiom of
the Lamas is alphabetical, much in the manner of our European
languages, yet they make no use of moveable type; stereotype
printing on wood is alone practised.&nbsp; The Thibetian books
resemble a large pack of cards; the leaves are moveable, and
printed on both sides.&nbsp; As they are neither sewn nor bound
together, in order to preserve them, they are placed between two
thin boards, which are fastened together with yellow bands.&nbsp;
The editions of the Thibetian books printed at Kounboum are very
rude, the letters are sprawling and coarse, and <!-- page 59--><a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>in all
respects very inferior to those which emanate from the imperial
printing press at Peking.&nbsp; The manuscript editions, on the
contrary, are magnificent; they are enriched with illustrative
designs, and the characters are elegantly traced.&nbsp; The Lamas
do not write with a brush like the Chinese, but use little sticks
of bamboo cut in the form of a pen; their inkstand is a little
copper box, resembling a jointed snuff-box, and which is filled
with cotton saturated with ink.&nbsp; The Lamas size their paper,
in order to prevent its blotting; for this purpose, instead of
the solution of alum used by the Chinese, they sprinkle the paper
with water mixed with one-tenth part of milk, a simple, ready,
and perfectly effective process.</p>

<p>Sandara the Bearded did not belong to any of the classes of
industrials that we have enumerated; he had a business of his
own, namely, that of <i>taking</i> in the strangers whom devotion
or other motives brought to the Lamasery.&nbsp; The
Mongol-Tartars in particular afforded him profitable employment
in this way.&nbsp; On their arrival he would introduce himself in
the character of <i>cicerone</i>, and, <!-- page 60--><a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>thanks to the
easy, seductive elegance of his manners and conversation, he
always managed to get engaged as their man of business during
their stay.&nbsp; At Kounboum itself Sandara&rsquo;s reputation
was by no means unequivocal.&nbsp; The better Lamas shunned him,
and some of them went so far as to give us a charitable hint not
to confide too much in his fine words, and always to keep an eye
upon our purse when in his company.&nbsp; We learned that,
compelled to quit Lha-Ssa for some knavery, he had vagabondized
for three years through the provinces of Sse-Tchouen and Kan-Sou,
as a strolling player and fortune-teller.&nbsp; We were not at
all surprised at this information.&nbsp; We had ourselves
remarked that whenever Sandara became frankly himself, his manner
was always that of an actor.</p>
<p>One evening, when he seemed in a more amiable humour than
ordinary, we thought we would extract from him some of his old
adventures.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sandara,&rdquo; said we, &ldquo;the
chattering Lamas here pretend that on your way from Thibet, you
remained three years in China.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The words are
truth.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;They say, too, that you are a capital
hand at stage recitations.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sandara rose, clacked a
sort of prelude with his fingers, threw himself into a theatrical
attitude, and recited, with emphasis, some Chinese verses.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A Lama comedian!&rdquo; said we, laughingly; &ldquo;this
is a marvel indeed!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; cried he;
&ldquo;I was first a Lama, then a comedian, and now I am a Lama
again.&nbsp; Come,&rdquo; continued he, resuming his accustomed
seat, &ldquo;since the chatterers have spoken to you of my
adventures, I will give you the real history of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After remaining for ten years at Lha-Ssa, in the
Lamasery of Sera, a longing for my country took possession of my
thoughts; the Three Vales occupied my soul.&nbsp; The malady at
length became so powerful, that I could not resist it.&nbsp; I
accordingly departed; having as my travelling companions four
Lamas of Amdo, who were also returning home.&nbsp; Instead of
pursuing the eastern route we proceeded southwards, for in that
direction the desert is not wholly uninhabited.&nbsp; We
journeyed, pack on back, and staff in hand.&nbsp; If on our way
we came to a black tent, we sought its hospitality, otherwise we
had to pass the night in the depths of some ravine, or beneath
some rock.&nbsp; You know that Thibet is a country covered with
great mountains; we had accordingly a continuous series of
ascendings and descendings.&nbsp; Although it was summer, we
frequently encountered heavy falls of snow.&nbsp; The nights were
very cold, but during the day, especially in the valleys, we were
almost killed with the heat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We walked on merrily, however.&nbsp; We were all in
good health and in good humour, more particularly when the
shepherds had <!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>made us a present of a kid, or a good
lump of butter.&nbsp; In the country through which we passed, we
saw some very singular animals; they were not so big as an
ordinary cat, and they were covered with a sort of hair as hard
as iron needles.&nbsp; Whenever one of these creatures perceived
us, it immediately rolled itself up, so that you could no longer
distinguish head, tail, or feet, and became, as it were, a great
ball, all bristling with long, hard thorns.&nbsp; At first these
beasts frightened us; we could not comprehend at all what they
were, for the books of prayer say not a word about them.&nbsp;
However, by degrees we got courage enough to examine them
closely.&nbsp; As these balls were too prickly to be touched with
the hand, we placed a stick horizontally across one of them, and
then pressed down both ends, until we made the ball open itself a
little, and then there came out a little face, like a
man&rsquo;s, that looked at us fixedly.&nbsp; We cried out in
great terror, and ran away as hard as we could.&nbsp; At last,
however, we grew accustomed to the little animals, and they even
served us for an amusement, for it was good fun to turn them over
and over down the hills, with the iron ends of our staves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We also met with worms of a very surprising kind.&nbsp;
One day when it was very hot, we were journeying along a little
stream that meandered through a valley, in which the grass grew
very high.&nbsp; Towards noon, after drinking tea, we lay down
and slept on the edge of the stream.&nbsp; You know that,
according to the rule of Tsong-Kaba, the yellow-mitred Lamas do
not wear trousers.&nbsp; When we woke up, we found a number of
worms sticking to our legs; they were of a grey colour, and as
big as one&rsquo;s finger.&nbsp; We tried to get them off, but
could not; and as we did not experience any pain from them, we
waited to see what would be the end of the affair.&nbsp;
By-and-by the beasts swelled, and when they had become quite
round and large, they dropped off themselves.&nbsp; Oh! Thibet is
a singular country.&nbsp; You see animals there that are found
nowhere else.&nbsp; Lamas who have not travelled in the country
won&rsquo;t believe what we tell them about it.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;They are wrong, then,&rdquo; said we, &ldquo;for what you
have just said is in perfect conformity with the truth.&nbsp;
These curious animals that you describe are not inhabitants of
Thibet only; they are very common in our country.&nbsp; Those
which are enveloped with sharp thorns, we call hedgehogs; and the
great worms we call leeches.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What! have you
seen animals of the kind?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Often.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear it, for you&rsquo;ll be able to
confirm what we say to any Lamas that don&rsquo;t believe
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we went on quite comfortably, till we came to the
Eul Mountain.&nbsp; This mountain is very lofty, and covered with
a great forest of pine and holly; we rested at the foot of it
during a whole <!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>day, in a black tent.&nbsp; When
night came, two of our number said: &lsquo;The evening is fine,
the moon bright; we can&rsquo;t do better than cross the mountain
in the cool of the night.&nbsp; In the morning it will grow hot,
and we shall find it much more laborious to climb the mountain
then.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;No,&rsquo; objected the others,
&lsquo;night is for wild beasts; men should only travel by
day.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thus, you see, we disagreed about the
matter.&nbsp; The two first persisted; they took up their
iron-pointed staves, fastened their packs on their shoulders, and
went on their way.&nbsp; This, you will admit, was an ill step to
take.&nbsp; When pilgrims have said: &lsquo;Let us journey
together,&rsquo; they should not part company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, when day broke, we also went on our way&mdash;we
three who remained of the five.&nbsp; Just as we were reaching
the summit of the Eul Mountain, &lsquo;Tsong-Kaba,&rsquo; cried
I, &lsquo;here is an iron-pointed staff on the
ground.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; said one of my
companions, looking at the staff, &lsquo;this is Lobzan&rsquo;s
staff.&rsquo;&nbsp; We examined it closely, and clearly
recognised it.&nbsp; &lsquo;This,&rsquo; said we, &lsquo;is what
people get by travelling at night.&nbsp; They drop something or
other, and there is not light enough for them to find it
again.&rsquo;&nbsp; We went on.&nbsp; After a short further and
very rugged ascent, we stepped on the plateau of the
mountain.&nbsp; We had no sooner done so, than all three sent
forth a cry of terror; for we saw before us another iron-pointed
staff, Lama&rsquo;s clothes torn in pieces, pieces of human
flesh, and bones broken and gnawed.&nbsp; The earth torn up, and
the grass trodden down, indicated that a severe struggle had
taken place on the spot.&nbsp; It was obvious at once that some
wild beasts, tigers or wolves, had killed and devoured our
companions.&nbsp; I stood for a moment panic-struck at the
horrible spectacle.&nbsp; Then I wept like a child.&nbsp; We
rushed down the other side of the mountain with fear-impelled
speed.&nbsp; From that moment our journey was a sad and silent
one.&nbsp; Only, when we came to a black tent, we would recount
to the shepherds the awful catastrophe of our poor comrades, and
the relation afforded some slight alleviation of our grief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three moons after our departure from Lha-Ssa, we
arrived at the frontier of China.&nbsp; There we separated; the
two Lamas of Amdo turned to the north, towards their own country;
while I, crossing the Wall of Ten Thousand Lis, entered the
province of Sse-Tchouen.&nbsp; After a few days&rsquo; march, I
found in an inn, a company of comedians.&nbsp; All night, these
people did nothing but sing, joke, and drink rice-wine.&nbsp;
&lsquo;In this country of Sse-Tchouen,&rsquo; said the manager of
the company to me, &lsquo;there are no Lamas.&nbsp; What do you
propose to do with that red robe and that yellow hat of
yours?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;You are quite right,&rsquo; said I;
&lsquo;in a country of Lamas, to be a Lama is well; but in a land
of comedians, one must be a comedian.&nbsp; <!-- page 63--><a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>Will you take
me into your company?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Bravo! bravo!&rsquo;
cried everybody; &lsquo;you shall be one of us.&rsquo;&nbsp; And
so saying, each made me a low bow, which I returned by putting my
tongue in my cheek, and scratching my ear, according to the
Thibetian manner of saluting.&nbsp; At first, I took the matter
as a joke; but by-and-by upon reflecting that I had no means
left, I thought I might as well take the manager at his word, and
accordingly I became a member of the corps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next day I packed up my religious costume, and assumed
a mundane suit.&nbsp; As my memory had been long disciplined by
the study of prayers, I found little trouble in learning a part
in a play, and in a few days I became quite a first-rate
comedian.&nbsp; We gave representations, during upwards of a
year, in all the towns and villages of Sse-Tchouen.&nbsp; The
company then resolving to visit the province of Yun-Nan, I
quitted them, because that expedition would have carried me too
far from my native Three Vallies.&nbsp; After the feast of
separation, accordingly I proceeded on my way to the paternal
roof.&nbsp; The journey occupied nearly two years.&nbsp; At every
place I came to, I stopped a few days and gave representations,
practising as a merry-andrew, and making a comfortable thing
enough of it, for one always gets more by performing on
one&rsquo;s own account.&nbsp; I entered my native village in
grand style, mounted on a magnificent ass I had bought at
Lan-Tcheou, and with twelve ounces of silver in my pocket.&nbsp;
I gave a few representations to my countrymen, who were amazed at
my skill; but I had soon to give up my new profession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One evening when the family were assembled to hear some
of my Thibetian stories, my mother maintained profound silence
and her face manifested utter grief; soon I observed the tears
trickling down her cheeks.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mother,&rsquo; asked I,
&lsquo;why do you weep?&nbsp; In my story was there anything to
excite your tears?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Thy story,&rsquo; she
replied, &lsquo;produces upon me no impression whatever,
agreeable or disagreeable; it strikes upon my ears, but makes no
way to my heart.&nbsp; That which moves, that which afflicts me,
is the thought that when thou left us, fourteen years ago, to
visit the Land of Saints, thou wert clothed in the sacred habit
of the Lamas, and that now thou art a layman and a
buffoon.&rsquo;&nbsp; These words confounded me.&nbsp; After a
moment&rsquo;s silence I rose and cried emphatically: &lsquo;It
is written in the Holy Doctrine, that it is better to honour
one&rsquo;s father and mother than to serve the spirits of heaven
and earth.&nbsp; Therefore, mother, say what you would have me
do, and your son will reverentially obey you.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Throw aside those mundane clothes,&rsquo; said my mother,
&lsquo;cut off that tress of hair, and re-enter the family of the
saints.&rsquo;&nbsp; I had nothing to say in reply, but
prostrated myself <!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>thrice on the ground, in token of
submission.&nbsp; When a mother speaks, one must obey; filial
piety is the basis of all good doctrine.&nbsp; In translating for
you the ten great commandments of Jehovah, I remember that the
fourth said: &lsquo;Thou shalt honour thy father and thy
mother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next morning I resumed my Lama dress, and a few days
after proceeded to Kounboum, where I am labouring to sanctify
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These last words of Sandara the Bearded clearly merited to be
received with a horse laugh, but we restrained ourselves by dint
of biting our lips, for we had experienced that, notwithstanding
his immense zeal for sanctification, our worthy tutor had not as
yet attained any very great results in the matter of patience and
mildness.</p>
<p>This summary of the adventures of Sandara, at once explained
to us how it was that upon all occasions he manifested such
marked predilection for the men and things of China.&nbsp; The
rules bequeathed by Tsong-Kaba interdicted to the Lamas the use
of garlic, brandy, and tobacco; garlic being prohibited because
it is unbecoming to present one&rsquo;s self before the image of
Buddha with bad breath, offensive in itself, and capable of
infecting the perfume of the incense; brandy, because this fatal
liquor disturbs the reason and excites the passions; and tobacco,
because it engenders idleness, and absorbs precious hours that
ought to be devoted to the study of prayers and of
doctrine.&nbsp; Despite these prohibitions, so soundly based, the
Lamas&mdash;such of them, at least, as sanctify themselves after
the manner of Sandara&mdash;do not hesitate to smoke, to drink,
and to season their oatmeal with garlic.&nbsp; All this, however,
is done secretly, and without the knowledge of the police.&nbsp;
In the Lamasery of Kounboum, Sandara was the patron and
introducer of the Chinese hawkers who deal in these contraband
articles, and aided them in the sale of their goods, for a small
commission.</p>
<p>A few days after the Feast of Flowers, we vigorously resumed
our Thibetian studies under the direction of Sandara, who came
every morning to work with us.&nbsp; We occupied ourselves in the
translation of an abridgment of Sacred History from the creation
to the preaching of the Apostles.&nbsp; We gave to this work the
dialogue form; the two interlocutors being a Lama of Jehovah and
a Lama of Buddha.&nbsp; Sandara fulfilled his functions
altogether as a matter of business.&nbsp; The favourable
tendencies which he at first manifested, when we were at
Tang-Keou-Eul, his crossings, his admiration of the Christian
doctrine, had been all a mere farce.&nbsp; Religious feelings had
no hold upon his grasping, hardened heart.&nbsp; He had acquired,
by his long abode among the Chinese, a sneering, cold-blooded,
carping incredulity, which he seemed to delight in <!-- page
65--><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>parading upon all occasions.&nbsp; In his estimation,
all religions were so many devices invented by the wise for the
more facile and effective despoilment of the witless.&nbsp;
Virtue, with him, was a vain word, and the man of merit, he who
made the most of his fellow men.</p>
<p>Despite, however, these sceptical and impious opinions,
Sandara could not prevent himself from feeling high admiration of
the Christian doctrine.&nbsp; He was especially struck with the
concatenation of the historical facts which he translated for
us.&nbsp; He found in them a character of authenticity, of which
the fables accumulated in the Buddhist books are wholly
destitute; he admitted this, not unfrequently, but always in an
unguarded moment, for his aim was to support in our presence his
melancholy part of a free-thinker.&nbsp; When he was with the
Lamas, he was more at his ease; and there he did not hesitate to
declare that as to religious doctrine, we knew more about it than
all the living Buddhas put together.</p>
<p>After some time, we began to make a certain sensation in the
Lamasery; the Lamas talked a good deal to one another about the
two Lamas of Jehovah, and the new doctrine they taught.&nbsp; It
was remarked that we were never seen to prostrate ourselves
before Buddha; that, thrice a day, we said prayers which were not
Thibetian prayers; that we had a language of our own, which
nobody else understood, but that with other people we talked
Tartarian, Chinese, and a little Thibetian.&nbsp; Here was more
than enough to excite the curiosity of the Lamanesque
public.&nbsp; Every day we had visitors, and the conversation
with them always and altogether turned upon religious
questions.&nbsp; Among all the Lamas who visited us, we did not
find one of the same incredulous stamp with Sandara the Bearded;
they all, on the contrary, seemed sincerely religious and full of
faith; many of them attached the utmost importance to the study
and knowledge of truth; and we found the same men coming again
and again to seek instruction from us in our holy religion.</p>
<p>The instruction we communicated was altogether historical in
its plan, everything being carefully excluded which could suggest
dispute, or arouse the spirit of contention; we gave our friends
a simple and concise outline of our religion, leaving them to
derive thence, for themselves, conclusions against
Buddhism.&nbsp; Proper names and dates, precisely set forth,
produced more effect upon them than the most logical
reasoning.&nbsp; When they had thoroughly mastered the names of
Jesus, of Jerusalem, of Pontius Pilate, the date of four thousand
years since the creation of the world, and the names of the
twelve Apostles, they had no longer any doubts as to the
Redemption, or as to the Preaching of the Gospel.&nbsp; The <!--
page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>connection which they observed between the history of
the Old Testament and that of the New, amounted, in their eyes,
to demonstration.&nbsp; The mysteries and the miracles created no
difficulty in their minds.</p>
<p>After all we have seen in our long peregrination, and
especially during our abode in the Lamasery of Kounboum, we are
persuaded that it is by instruction, and not by controversy, that
the conversion of the heathen is to be efficaciously
operated.&nbsp; Polemics may reduce an adversary to silence, may
often humiliate him, may sometimes irritate him, but they will
never convince him.&nbsp; When Jesus Christ sent forth his
disciples, he said to them: Go forth and teach all nations, which
does not mean: go forth and hold controversies with all
nations.&nbsp; In our days, two schools of philosophy, the one
recognising Descartes for its head, the other Lamennais, have
much disputed the question whether paganism is a crime or an
error; it appears to us to be neither the one nor the other, but
simply the effect of ignorance.&nbsp; The spirit of a pagan is
enveloped in darkness.&nbsp; Carry light within that darkness,
and the darkness will disappear: the pagan needs neither the
thesis of the Cartesians, nor the requisitory of the
Lamennaisians: all he wants is instruction.</p>
<p>The eagerness of the Lamas to visit us, and especially their
favourable tendencies towards Christianity, gave, after a while,
umbrage to the zealous tenacity of Sandara; he turned desperately
sulky, and after going through the lesson of the day, in the
driest and briefest manner possible, he would say not another
word to us for the rest of the twenty-four hours, but observe
towards us the most contumelious silence.&nbsp; If we asked him
in the humblest manner the Thibetian name of some object, or the
meaning of some particular phrase in the Dialogues, he would not
condescend to a word of reply.&nbsp; In this extremity we usually
had recourse to our neighbour, the young student in medicine, who
always gave us the information we needed with the most frank
cordiality; and although he was not very learned in Thibetian, we
found him of very great utility.&nbsp; His open, good-natured
character, moreover, encouraged us to ask him many questions
respecting some of the Lama practices, which we desired to
understand.&nbsp; In return for these services, we aided, with
all our hearts, his desire to become acquainted with the
Christian religion.&nbsp; Far different from Sandara, he was full
of respect for the truths we announced to him; but his timid,
irresolute temperament kept him from openly abjuring
Buddhism.&nbsp; His idea was, that he could be, at one and the
same time, a good Christian and a fervent Buddhist; in his
prayers, he invoked alternately Tsong-Kaba and Jehovah, and he
carried his <!-- page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 67</span>simplicity so far as to ask us
sometimes to take part in his religious practices.</p>

</a></p>
<p>One day he proposed to us a service of devotion in favour of
all the travellers throughout the whole world.&nbsp; &ldquo;We
are not acquainted with this devotion,&rdquo; said we;
&ldquo;will you explain it to us?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;This is it:
you know that a good many travellers find themselves, from time
to time, on rugged, toilsome roads.&nbsp; Some of these
travellers are holy Lamas on a pilgrimage; and it often happens
that they cannot proceed by reason of their being altogether
exhausted; in this case we aid them by sending horses to
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That,&rdquo; said we, &ldquo;is a most
admirable custom, entirely conformable with the principles of
Christian charity; but you must consider that poor travellers
such as we are not in a position to participate in the good work;
you know that we possess only a horse and a little mule, which
require rest, in order that they may carry us into
Thibet.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Tsong-Kaba!&rdquo; ejaculated the
Lisper, and then he clapped his <!-- page 68--><a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>hands
together, and burst into a loud laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;What are you
laughing at?&nbsp; What we have said is the simple truth: we have
only a horse and a little mule.&rdquo;&nbsp; When his laughter at
last subsided: &ldquo;It was not that I was laughing at,&rdquo;
said he; &ldquo;I laughed at your misconceiving the sort of
devotion I mean; what we send to the travellers are paper
horses.&rdquo;&nbsp; And therewith he ran off to his cell,
leaving us with an excellent occasion for laughing in our turn at
the charity of the Buddhists, which we thus learned consisted in
giving paper horses to travellers.&nbsp; We maintained our
gravity, however, for we had made it a rule never to ridicule the
practices of the Lamas.&nbsp; Presently the Lisper returned, his
hands filled with bits of paper, on each of which was printed the
figure of a horse, saddled and bridled, and going at full
gallop.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here!&rdquo; cried the Lisper, &ldquo;these
are the horses we send to the travellers.&nbsp; To-morrow we
shall ascend a high mountain, thirty lis from the Lamasery, and
there we shall pass the day, saying prayers and sending off
horses.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How do you send them to the
travellers?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh! the means are very
easy.&nbsp; After a certain form of prayer, we take a packet of
horses which we throw up into the air, the wind carries them
away, and by the power of Buddha they are then changed into real
horses, which offer themselves to travellers.&rdquo;&nbsp; We
candidly told our dear neighbour what we thought of this
practice, and explained to him the grounds upon which we declined
to take any part in it.&nbsp; He seemed to approve of our
sentiments on the subject; but this approval did not prevent him
from occupying a large portion of the night in fabricating, by
means of the press, a prodigious number of horses.</p>
<p>Next morning, before daybreak, he went off, accompanied by
several colleagues, full, like himself, of devotion for poor
travellers.&nbsp; They carried with them a tent, a boiler, and
some provisions.&nbsp; All the morning the wind blew a hurricane;
when, towards noon, this subsided, the sky became dark and heavy,
and the snow fell in thick flakes.&nbsp; We awaited, with anxious
impatience, the return of the Stutterer.&nbsp; The poor wretch
returned in the evening, quite worn out with cold and
fatigue.&nbsp; We invited him to rest for awhile in our tent, and
we gave him some tea with milk, and some rolls fried in
butter.&nbsp; &ldquo;It has been a dreadful day,&rdquo; said
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, the wind blew here with great
violence.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll venture to affirm it was
nothing here to what we found it on the top of the mountain: the
tent, the boiler&mdash;everything we had with us was carried away
by a regular whirlwind, and we were obliged to throw ourselves
flat on the ground in order to save ourselves from being carried
away too.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sad pity you&rsquo;ve
lost your tent and boiler.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is, indeed, a
misfortune.&nbsp; However, it must be admitted that the weather
was <!-- page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>very favourable for conveying horses to the
travellers.&nbsp; When we saw that it was going to snow, we threw
them all up into the air at once, and the wind whisked them off
to the four quarters of the world.&nbsp; If we had waited any
longer, the snow would have wetted them, and they would have
stuck on the sides of the mountain.&rdquo;&nbsp; Altogether this
excellent young man was not dissatisfied with his day&rsquo;s
work.</p>
<p>The twenty-fifth of each moon is the day devoted to the
transmission of horses to poor travellers.&nbsp; The practice is
not a general rule; but is left to the devotion of
individuals.&nbsp; The twenty-eighth of the moon is set apart for
another species of religious exercise, in which all the Lamas are
required to participate.&nbsp; On the twenty-seventh the
Stammerer gave us notice of the ceremony in these words:
&ldquo;To-morrow night we shall, perhaps, prevent your sleeping,
for we shall have to celebrate our nocturnal
prayers.&rdquo;&nbsp; We paid no special attention to this
intimation, conceiving that it simply meant that in the course of
the night, the Lamas would recite prayers in their cells, as they
not unfrequently did.&nbsp; We accordingly retired to rest at our
usual hour, and fell asleep.</p>
<p>Conformably with the warning of the Stammerer, our slumbers
did not remain long uninterrupted.&nbsp; First we seemed to dream
that we heard a sort of concert by a great multitude of voices up
in the air.&nbsp; Imperceptibly these vague, confused sounds
became loud and distinct.&nbsp; We awoke and heard clearly enough
the chanting of Lamanesque prayers.&nbsp; In the twinkling of an
eye, we were up and dressed and out in the courtyard, which was
illumined with a pale light that appeared to descend from
above.&nbsp; In his wonted corner sat old Akay&eacute; telling
his beads.&nbsp; &ldquo;Akay&eacute;,&rdquo; asked we,
&ldquo;what is this strange noise?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The
nocturnal prayers.&nbsp; If you want to see more of them you had
better go on to the terrace.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was a ladder
resting in the most accommodating manner against the wall.&nbsp;
We hastily ascended it, and became spectators of a most singular
sight.&nbsp; The terraces were illuminated by red lanterns
suspended from long poles, and all the Lamas, attired in their
state mantles and yellow mitres, were seated on the roofs of
their houses chanting their prayers with a slow and monotonous
voice.&nbsp; On the roof of our own house we found the Stammerer,
the Kitat-Lama, and his Chabi, wholly absorbed with the
ceremony.&nbsp; We took care not to disturb them, and contented
ourselves with merely looking on and listening.&nbsp; Those
innumerable lanterns, with their red, fantastic glare, the
buildings of the Lamasery vaguely illumined by the reflection of
their trembling light, the four thousand voices combining in one
immense concert, accompanied from time to time by the sound of
trumpets and marine conchs&mdash;all this <!-- page 70--><a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>produced an
effect that agitated the soul with a sort of vague terror.</p>
<p>After having gazed for awhile at this strange spectacle, we
descended into the courtyard, where we found old Akay&eacute;
still in the same place and the same position.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you have seen the ceremony of
nocturnal prayers?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, but we don&rsquo;t
understand what they precisely mean.&nbsp; Would it be troubling
you too much to ask from you some explanation of the
matter?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Not at all.&nbsp; These prayers were
instituted for the purpose of driving away demons.&nbsp; You must
know that this country was once fearfully infested with demons,
who caused maladies in the herds and spoiled the milk of the
cows; they often invaded the cells of the Lamas, and at times
carried their audacity to the excess of penetrating into the
temple in the hour of general prayer, their presence being
indicated by the confusion and discordance which immediately
prevailed in the psalmody.&nbsp; During the night they assembled
in large numbers in the ravine, where they frightened everybody
with cries and howlings so strange in their character that no man
could imitate them.&nbsp; A Lama, full of learning and piety,
invented the nocturnal prayers, and the demons have since almost
entirely disappeared from the district.&nbsp; A few come here
occasionally, but they don&rsquo;t do any mischief as they used
to do.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Akay&eacute;,&rdquo; asked we,
&ldquo;have you ever chanced to see any of these
demons?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, never; and I&rsquo;m sure you
have not seen any of them.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What makes you
suppose so?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Because the demons only appear to
wicked Lamas, and the good Lamas never see them.&rdquo;&nbsp; At
this moment the prayer of the Lamas on the house-tops ceased, the
trumpets, the bells, the drums, and the marine conchs sounded all
at once three different times; the Lamas, then, all sent forth
together hideous cries and yells, like those of wild beasts, and
the ceremony terminated.&nbsp; The lanterns were extinguished,
and silence resumed its sway.&nbsp; We bade old Akay&eacute; good
night, and once more went to sleep.</p>
<p>We had been residing at Kounboum more than three months,
enjoying the friendly sympathies of the Buddhist monks and the
protection of the authorities.&nbsp; But for some time past we
had been in flagrant opposition to a leading rule of the
Lamasery.&nbsp; Strangers who pass through Kounboum, or who
merely reside there for a short time, may dress as they
please.&nbsp; Those persons, on the contrary, who are connected
in any way with the Lamasery, or who are making any stay in the
place, are required to wear the sacred dress of the Lamas, that
is to say, a red gown, a small dalmatica without sleeves and
showing the arm, a red scarf, and a yellow mitre.&nbsp; This rule
of uniformity is very strictly enforced; and <!-- page 71--><a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>accordingly,
one fine morning, the Grand Discipline-Lama sent an official
formally to request that we would observe the statutes of the
Lamasery.&nbsp; We replied that, not being of the religion of
Buddha, we could not adopt the sacred dress of the Lama, without
insulting our own holy religion; but that as we did not wish to
create the slightest confusion in the establishment, we were
ready to quit it, if we could not obtain a dispensation in the
matter of costume.</p>
<p>Several days passed without any thing further being said on
this unpleasant subject.&nbsp; Meantime Samdadchiemba arrived
with the three camels, which he had been pasturing in a valley of
Koukou-Noor.&nbsp; If we had to remove, it was clear that his
return was most opportune.&nbsp; By-and-by, the Lamanesque
government once more sent us their envoy, to say that the rule of
the Lamasery was inflexible; that they grieved that our sublime
and sacred religion did not permit us to comply with it; but that
although we could not remain in the Lamasery of Kounboum, they
would gladly retain us in the neighbourhood, and that to this end
they invited us to go and take up our abode at Tchogortan, where
we might wear what dress we pleased.</p>
<p>We had heard a great deal about the little Lamasery of
Tchogortan, which serves as a sort of country house and botanical
garden for the Faculty of Medicine.&nbsp; It stands within
half-an-hour&rsquo;s walk of Kounboum.&nbsp; The Grand Lamas and
students of the medical section proceed thither every year,
towards the close of summer, and remain generally for about a
fortnight, collecting medicinal plants on the surrounding
hills.&nbsp; During the remainder of the year most of the houses
are empty, and you scarcely see a single soul, except a few
contemplative Lamas who have hollowed out cells for themselves in
the most rugged declivities of the mountain.</p>
<p>The proposition of the Lamanesque government appeared to us
altogether eligible, for the fine weather was just setting in;
winter in town, spring in the country&mdash;this was
admirable!&nbsp; Our three months abode at Kounboum had made us
tolerably conversant with Lama manners; we accordingly purchased
a khata and a small dish of raisins, with which we repaired to
the Lama administrator of Tchogortan, who received us in the most
affable manner, and promised at once to give orders for the
preparation of a suitable abode for us.&nbsp; After giving a
splendid Feast of Farewell to old Akay&eacute;, the Kitat-Lama,
and the Stammerer, we loaded our camels with our baggage and
gaily proceeded on our way to the little Lamasery.</p>

<p>A half hour sufficed for us to effect our removal from
Kounboum to Tchogortan.&nbsp; After skirting for some time the
arid sides of a lofty mountain, we descended into a broad valley,
through which flowed a rivulet, the banks of which were still
covered with ice.&nbsp; The place seemed full of good pasturage,
but in consequence of <!-- page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 73</span>the coldness of the climate,
vegetation is very slow and very late in the locality.&nbsp;
Although it was near the month of May, the nascent germs scarcely
as yet coloured the surface of the soil.</p>
<p>A Lama, with red, round face, came to meet us, and conducted
us to the habitation which the administrator of the Lamasery had
prepared for our reception.&nbsp; We were installed in a large
apartment which, only the evening before, had served as the abode
of sundry juvenile calves, too young and too weak to follow the
parent cows to the mountains.&nbsp; Every pains had been taken to
clean the apartment, but the success had not been so perfect as
to preclude our distinguishing on the floor many traces of the
late occupants; however, the authorities had assigned to us the
best accommodation that the Lamasery afforded.</p>
<p>Tchogortan is, as we have before stated, the country house of
the Faculty of Medicine of Kounboum: its aspect is tolerably
picturesque, especially in summer.&nbsp; The habitations of the
Lamas, constructed at the foot of a mountain, that terminates in
a peak, are shaded by ancient trees, the great branches of which
afford a retreat to infinite kites and crows.&nbsp; Some feet
below these cottages, runs an abundant stream, interrupted by
various dams which the Lamas have constructed for the purpose of
turning their tchukor, or praying mills.&nbsp; In the depths of
the valley, and on the adjacent hills, you see the black tents of
the Si-Fan, and a few herds of goats and long-haired
cattle.&nbsp; The rocky and rugged mountain which backs the
Lamasery, serves as an abode for five contemplative monks, who,
like the eagles, have selected as the site of their aeries the
most elevated and most inaccessible points.&nbsp; Some have
hollowed out their retreat in the living rock; others dwell in
wooden cells, stuck against the mountain like enormous
swallows&rsquo; nests; a few pieces of wood, driven into the
rock, form the staircase by which they ascend or descend.&nbsp;
One of these Buddhist hermits, indeed, who has entirely renounced
the world, has voluntarily deprived himself of these means of
communication with his fellows; a bag, tied to a long string,
served as the medium for conveying to him the alms of the Lamas
and shepherds.</p>
<p>We had frequent conversations with these contemplative Lamas,
but we could never exactly ascertain what it was they
contemplated up there in their nests.&nbsp; They themselves could
give nothing like a clear idea of the matter; they had embraced
this manner of life, they told us, because they had read in their
books that Lamas of very great sanctity had lived in that
way.&nbsp; However, they were worthy folks, of peaceful, simple,
easy temperaments, who passed their waking hours in prayer, and
when they were tired of praying relaxed with sleep.</p>
<p><!-- page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>Besides these five hermits, who always dwelt in the
rocks above, there were, below, several Lamas who had charge of
the unoccupied houses of the Lamasery.&nbsp; These by no means,
like the former, looked at life in its refined and mystical
aspect; they were, on the contrary, absorbed in the realities of
this world; they were, in fact, herdsmen.&nbsp; In the great
house where we were installed, there were two big Lamas who
poetically passed their time in herding some twenty cattle, in
milking the cows, making butter and cheese, and looking after the
juvenile calves.&nbsp; These bucolics seemed little to heed
contemplation or prayer: they sent forth, indeed, frequent
invocations to Tsong-Kaba, but this was always on account of
their beasts, because their cows mutinied and would not be
milked, or because the calves capered out of bounds over the
valley.&nbsp; Our arrival afforded them a little diversion from
the monotony of pastoral life.&nbsp; They often paid us a visit
in our chamber, and always passed in review the volumes of our
small travelling library, with that timid and respectful
curiosity which simple and illiterate persons ever manifest
towards the productions of the intellect.&nbsp; When they found
us writing, they forgot cows, and calves, and milk, and cheese,
and butter, and would stand for hours together motionless, their
eyes fixed upon our crow-quill as it ran over the paper, and left
impressed there characters, the delicacy and novelty of which
were matters of ecstatic amazement to these simple creatures.</p>
<p>The little Lamasery of Tchogortan pleased us beyond our
hopes.&nbsp; We never once regretted Kounboum any more than the
prisoner regrets his dungeon after he has attained liberty.&nbsp;
The reason was that we, too, felt ourselves emancipated.&nbsp; We
were no longer under the ferule of Sandara the Bearded, of that
hard and pitiless taskmaster, who, while giving us lessons of
Thibetian, seemed to have undertaken also to discipline us in
patience and humility.&nbsp; The desire to attain knowledge had
made us submit to his ill-treatment, but our departure from
Kounboum afforded a joyful opportunity of throwing off this leech
which had, for five whole months, obstinately remained stuck to
our existence.&nbsp; Besides, the success we had already achieved
in the study of the Thibetian tongue, exempted us from the future
necessity of having a master at our shoulder; we were quite
strong enough now to walk alone and unaided.</p>
<p>Our hours of labour were employed in revising and analysing
our dialogues, and in translating a small Thibetian work,
entitled, the &ldquo;Forty-two Points of Instruction, delivered
by Buddha.&rdquo;&nbsp; We possessed a magnificent edition of
this work, in four languages, Thibetian, Mongol, Mantchou, and
Chinese; so that, thus aided, we had no occasion to recur to the
learning of the Lamas.&nbsp; When the <!-- page 75--><a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>Thibetian
version presented any difficulty, all we had to do, in order to
remove it, was to consult the three other versions, with which we
were familiarly acquainted.</p>
<p>The book in question, which is attributed to Chakya-Mouni, is
a collection of precepts and sentences, urging men, and
especially religious persons, to the practice of piety.&nbsp; In
order to give our readers an idea of the morality of the
Buddhists, we will extract a few passages from this work, which
is of high authority in Lamanism.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buddha, the Supreme of Beings, manifesting his
doctrine, pronounced these words: There are, in living creatures,
ten species of acts which are called good, and there are also ten
species of acts which are called evil.&nbsp; If you ask, what are
the ten evil acts; there are three which appertain to the body:
murder, theft, and impurity.&nbsp; The four appertaining to
speech are: words sowing discord, insulting maledictions,
impudent lies, and hypocritical expressions.&nbsp; The three
appertaining to the will are: envy, anger, and malignant
thoughts.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">II.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buddha, manifesting his doctrine, pronounced these
words: The wicked man, who persecutes the good man, is like a
madman, who, throwing back his head, spits against heaven; his
spittle, incapable of sullying heaven, merely falls back upon
himself.&nbsp; And, again, he is like one who, the wind opposing
him, throws dust at men; the dust does not touch the men at whom
it was aimed, but flies back into the eyes of him who threw
it.&nbsp; Beware of persecuting good men lest calamities
exterminate you.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">III.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buddha, etc.&nbsp; Beneath heaven there are twenty
difficult things.&nbsp; 1, Being poor and indigent, to grant
benefits is difficult.&nbsp; 2, Being rich and exalted, to study
doctrine, is difficult.&nbsp; 3, Having offered up the sacrifice
of one&rsquo;s life, to die veritably, is difficult.&nbsp; 4, To
obtain a sight of the prayers of Buddha, is difficult.&nbsp; 5,
To have the happiness to be born in the world of Buddha, is
difficult.&nbsp; 6, To compound with voluptuousness and to be
delivered from one&rsquo;s passions, is difficult.&nbsp; 7, To
behold an agreeable object, and not to desire it, is
difficult.&nbsp; 8, To resist a tendency for the lucrative and
the exalting, is difficult.&nbsp; 9, To be insulted, and abstain
from anger, is difficult.&nbsp; 10, In the whirlwind of business
to be calm, is <!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>difficult.&nbsp; 11, To study much
and profoundly, is difficult.&nbsp; 12, Not to scorn a man who
has not studied, is difficult.&nbsp; 13, To extirpate pride from
the heart, is difficult.&nbsp; 11, To find a virtuous and able
master, is difficult.&nbsp; 15, To penetrate the secrets of
nature and the profundities of science, is difficult.&nbsp; 16,
Not to be excited by prosperity, is difficult.&nbsp; 17, To leave
wealth for wisdom, is difficult.&nbsp; 18, To induce men to
follow the dictates of conscience, is difficult.&nbsp; 19, To
keep one&rsquo;s heart always in equal motion, is
difficult.&nbsp; 20, Not to speak ill of others, is
difficult.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">IV.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man who seeks riches, is like a child that, with
the sharp point of a knife, attempts to eat honey; ere he has
time to relish the sweetness that has but touched his lips,
nothing remains to him but the poignant pain of a cut in the
tongue.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">V.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no passion more violent than
voluptuousness!&nbsp; No thing exceeds voluptuousness!&nbsp;
Happily, there is but one passion of this kind; were there two,
not a man in the whole universe could follow the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">VI.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buddha pronounced these words in the presence of all
the Charmanas: <a name="citation76"></a><a href="#footnote76"
class="citation">[76]</a>&nbsp; &lsquo;Beware of fixing your eyes
upon women!&nbsp; If you find yourselves in their company, let it
be as though you were not present.&nbsp; Take care how you speak
with women.&nbsp; If you talk with them, guard well your hearts;
let your conduct be irreproachable, and keep ever saying to
yourselves: we who are Charmanas, residing in this world of
corruption, must be like the flower of the water-lily, which,
amid muddy water, contracts no stain.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">VII.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man who walks in the path of piety must look upon
the passions as dry grass near a great fire.&nbsp; The man who is
jealous of his virtue, should flee on the approach of the
passions.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">VIII.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Charmana who passed whole nights chanting prayers,
manifested one morning, by his sad suppressed voice, great <!--
page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>depression and the desire to withdraw from his
calling.&nbsp; Buddha sent for this Charmana, and said to him,
&lsquo;When you were with your family, what used you to
do?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I was always playing on the
guitar.&rsquo;&nbsp; Buddha said to him, &lsquo;If the strings of
the guitar became loose, what happened?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I
obtained no sound from them.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;If the strings
were too tight, what happened then?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;The
sounds were broken.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;When the strings obtained
the exact equilibrium between tension and flexibility, what
happened then?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;All the sounds accorded in
perfect harmony.&rsquo;&nbsp; Hereupon Buddha pronounced these
words: &lsquo;It is the same with the study of doctrine; after
you shall have achieved dominion over your heart, and regulated
its movements to harmony, it will attain the acquisition of the
truth.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">IX.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buddha put this question to a Charmana: &lsquo;How long
a time is fixed for the life of man?&rsquo;&nbsp; He replied:
&lsquo;It is limited to a few days.&rsquo;&nbsp; Buddha
pronounced these words: &lsquo;You have not yet acquired the
knowledge of the doctrine.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then addressing himself
to another Charmana, he put this question: &lsquo;How long a time
is fixed for the life of man?&rsquo;&nbsp; He replied: &lsquo;It
is limited to the time that suffices for a meal.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Buddha pronounced these words: &lsquo;So neither hast thou, as
yet, the knowledge of the doctrine.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then addressing
himself to a third Charmana, he put to him this question:
&lsquo;How long a time is fixed for the life of man?&rsquo;&nbsp;
He replied: &lsquo;It is limited to the time that suffices to
emit a breath.&rsquo;&nbsp; After he had thus spoken, Buddha
pronounced these words: &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis well: thou mayest be
said to have acquired the knowledge of the doctrine.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">X.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man who, practising piety, applies himself to
extirpate the roots of his passions, is like a man passing
between his fingers the beads of a chaplet.&nbsp; If he proceeds
by taking them, one after the other, he easily attains the end;
so, by extirpating, one after the other, one&rsquo;s evil
tendencies one attains perfection.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">XI.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Charmana who practises piety, may compare himself
with the long-haired ox, which, laden with baggage, is making its
way through a marsh; it dares look neither to the right nor to
the left, but goes straight on, hoping to get clear of the mud
and to reach a place of rest.&nbsp; The Charmana, regarding his
passions as more <!-- page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>terrible than this mud, if he never
diverts his eyes from virtue, will assuredly attain the height of
felicity.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We will not prolong these extracts.&nbsp; The few we have
given will suffice to convey an idea of the matter and manner of
this book, which is accepted as an authority alike by the Bonzes
and the Lamas.&nbsp; It was conveyed from India to China, in the
65th year of the Christian era, at the epoch when Buddhism was
beginning to make its way in the Celestial Empire.&nbsp; The
Chinese annals relate this event in the following
terms:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In the 24th year of the reign of
Tchao-Wang, of the dynasty of the Tcheou (which corresponds to
the year 1029 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>), on the eighth day
of the fourth moon, a light, coming from the south-west,
illumined the palace of the king.&nbsp; The monarch, beholding
this splendour, interrogated concerning it the sages who were
skilled in predicting the future.&nbsp; These presented to him
the books wherein it was written, that this prodigy would
announce that a great saint had appeared in the west, and that in
a thousand years after his birth, his religion would spread into
those parts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the 53rd year of the reign of Mou-Wang, which is
that of the Black Ape (951 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>), on
the fifteenth day of the second moon, Buddha manifested himself
(<i>i.e.</i> died.)&mdash;A thousand and thirteen years
afterwards, under the dynasty of Ming-Ti, of the dynasty of the
Han, in the seventh year of the reign of Young-Ping (<span
class="smcap">a.d.</span> 64), on the fifteenth day of the first
moon, the king saw in a dream, a man of the colour of gold,
glittering like the sun, and whose stature was more than ten
feet.&nbsp; Having entered the palace of the king, this man said,
&lsquo;My religion will spread over these parts.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Next day, the king questioned the sages.&nbsp; One of these,
named Fou-Y, opening the annals of the time of the Emperor
Tchao-Wang, of the dynasty of the Tcheou, pointed out the
connection between the dream of the king and the narrative in the
annals.&nbsp; The king consulted the ancient books, and having
found the passage corresponding with the reign of Tchao-Wang, of
the dynasty of the Tcheou, was filled with gladness.&nbsp;
Thereupon he dispatched the officers Tsa-In and Thsin-King, the
man-of-letters, Wang-Tsun, and fifteen other persons, into the
west, to obtain information respecting the doctrine of
Buddha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the 10th year (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 67),
Tsa-In and the rest, having arrived in Central India, among the
great Youei-Tchi, met with Kas&rsquo;yamatanga and Tcho-Fa-Lan,
and procured a statute of Buddha, and books in the language of
Fan (Fan-Lan-Mo, or Brahma, that is to say, in Sanscrit), and
conveyed them on a white horse to the city Yo-Lang.&nbsp;
Kas&rsquo;yamatanga and Tcho-Fa-Lan, paid a visit to the emperor,
attired as religious persons, and were <!-- page 79--><a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>lodged in the
Hong-Lon-Ss&eacute;, called also Sse-Pin-Ss&eacute; (Hotel of the
Strangers).</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the 11th year (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 68),
the emperor ordered the construction of the monastery of the
White Horse, outside the gate Yong-Mon, west of the city of
Lo-Yang.&nbsp; Matanga there translated the &lsquo;Sacred Book of
Forty-two Articles.&rsquo;&nbsp; Six years after, Tsa-In and
Tcho-Fa-Lan converted certain Tao-Ss&eacute; to Buddhism.&nbsp;
Rising afterwards into celestial space, they caused the king to
hear the following verses:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The fox is not of the race of the lions.&nbsp;
The lamp has not the brightness of the sun or moon.&nbsp; The
lake cannot be compared with the sea; the hills cannot be
compared with the lofty mountains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The cloud of prayer spreading over the surface
of the earth, its beneficial dew fecundating the germs of
happiness, and the divine rites operating everywhere marvellous
changes, all the nations will advance according to the laws of
reintegration.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our first days at Tchogortan were entirely devoted to the
translation of the &ldquo;Book of Buddha;&rdquo; but we soon
found ourselves compelled to devote a portion of our time to the
occupations of pastoral life.&nbsp; We had remarked that every
evening our animals had returned half-starved, that instead of
growing fatter and fatter, they were daily becoming leaner and
leaner: the simple reason was that Samdadchiemba took no sort of
pains to find pasturage for them.&nbsp; After driving them out
somewhere or other, he cared not whither, he would leave them to
themselves on some arid hillside, and himself go to sleep in the
sun, or stroll about chattering and tea-drinking in the black
tents.&nbsp; It was to no purpose we lectured him; he went on,
just the same as before, his reckless, independent character
having undergone no modification whatever.&nbsp; Our only mode of
remedying the evil, was to turn herdsmen ourselves.</p>
<p>Moreover, it was impossible to remain pertinaciously and
exclusively men of letters when all around seemed inviting us to
make some concessions to the habits of this pastoral
people.&nbsp; The Si-Fan, or Eastern Thibetians, are nomads, like
the Tartar-Mongols, and pass their lives solely occupied in the
care of their flocks and herds.&nbsp; They do not live, however,
like the Mongol tribes, in huts covered with felt.&nbsp; The
great tents they construct with black linen, are ordinarily
hexagonal in form; within you see neither column nor woodwork
supporting the edifice; the six angles below are fastened to the
ground with nails, and those above are supported by cords which,
at a certain distance from the tent, rest horizontally on strong
poles, and then slope to the ground, where they are attached to
large iron rings.&nbsp; With all this strange complication <!--
page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>of sticks and strings, the black tent of the Thibetian
nomads bears no slight resemblance to a great spider standing
motionless on its long lanky legs, but so that its great stomach
is resting on the ground.&nbsp; The black tents are by no means
comparable with the tents of the Mongols; they are not a whit
warmer or more solid than ordinary travelling tents.&nbsp; They
are very cold, on the contrary, and a strong wind knocks them
down without the least difficulty.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p80.jpg">
<img alt=
"The Long-Haired Ox"
title=
"The Long-Haired Ox"
src="images/p80.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>It may be said, however, that in one respect the Si-Fan seem
more advanced than the Mongols, and to have a tendency for
approximating to the manners of sedentary nations.&nbsp; When
they have selected an encampment, they are accustomed to erect
around it, a wall of from four to five feet high, and within
their tents they construct furnaces, which are destitute neither
of taste nor of solidity.&nbsp; These arrangements, however, do
not create in them any attachment to the soil which they have
thus occupied.&nbsp; Upon the slightest caprice they decamp,
pulling down their walls and other masonry work, and carrying the
principal stones with them to their next settlement, as part of
their furniture.&nbsp; The herds of the Eastern Thibetians
consist of sheep, goats, and long-haired cattle; they do not
breed as many horses as the Tartars, but those which they do
breed are stronger and better formed; the camels we find in their
country, belong, for the most part, to the Tartar-Mongols.</p>
<p><!-- page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>The long-haired cattle, in Chinese Tchang-Mao-Nieou, is
called <i>yak</i> by the Thibetians, <i>sarligue</i> by the
Tartars, and <i>b&oelig;uf grognant</i> by the French
naturalists.&nbsp; The cry of this animal does, in fact, resemble
the grunting of a hog; but louder in tone, and longer in
duration.&nbsp; The yak is short and thick, and not so big as an
ordinary ox; its hair is long, fine, and shining, that under the
belly actually trailing on the around.&nbsp; Its hoofs are
meagre, and crooked, like those of goats; and, like the goats, it
delights in clambering up rocks, and impending over the most
rugged precipices.&nbsp; When at play, it twists and turns about
its tail, which terminates in a broad tuft, like a plume of
feathers.&nbsp; The flesh is excellent; the milk delicious, and
the butter made of that milk beyond all praise.&nbsp; Malte-Brun,
indeed, says, that the milk of this animal smacks of
tallow.&nbsp; Matters of taste are generally open questions, but
in this particular instance we may anticipate that the
presumption will be somewhat in favour of our opinion, since, as
we believe, the learned geographer has not had the same
opportunities with ourselves of drinking the milk in the black
tents, and appreciating its savour at leisure.</p>
<p>Among the herds of the Si-Fan, you find some yellow cattle,
which are of the same family with the ordinary cattle of France,
but in general poor and ugly.&nbsp; The calf of a long-haired cow
and a yellow bull is called Karba; these seldom live.&nbsp; The
long-tailed cows are so restive and so difficult to milk, that to
keep them at all quiet, the herdsman has to give them a calf to
lick meanwhile.&nbsp; But for this device, not a single drop of
milk could be obtained from them.</p>
<p>One day, a Lama herdsman, who lived in the same house with
ourselves, came, with a long, dismal face, to announce that one
of his cows had calved during the night, and that unfortunately
the calf was a karba.&nbsp; The calf died in the course of the
day.&nbsp; The Lama forthwith skinned the poor beast, and stuffed
it with hay.&nbsp; This proceeding surprised us at first, for the
Lama had by no means the air of a man likely to give himself the
luxury of a cabinet of natural history.&nbsp; When the operation
was completed, we remarked that the hay-calf had neither feet nor
head; hereupon it occurred to us that, after all, it was merely a
pillow that the Lama contemplated.&nbsp; We were in error, but
the error was not dissipated until the next morning, when our
herdsman went to milk his cow.&nbsp; Seeing him issue forth, his
pail in one hand, the hay-calf under the other arm, the fancy
occurred to us to follow him.&nbsp; His first proceeding was to
put the hay-karba down before the cow; he then turned to milk the
cow herself.&nbsp; The mamma at first opened enormous eyes at her
beloved infant; by degrees, she stooped <!-- page 82--><a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>her head
towards it, then smelt at it, sneezed three or four times, and at
last proceeded to lick it with the most delightful
tenderness.&nbsp; This spectacle grated against our
sensibilities; it seemed to us that he who first invented this
parody upon one of the most touching incidents in nature, must
have been a man without a heart.&nbsp; A somewhat burlesque
circumstance occurred one day to modify the indignation with
which this trickery inspired us.&nbsp; By dint of caressing and
licking her little calf, the tender parent one fine morning
unripped it; the hay issued from within, and the cow, manifesting
not the smallest surprise or agitation, proceeded tranquilly to
devour the unexpected provender.</p>
<p>The Si-Fan nomads are readily distinguishable from the Mongols
by a more expressive physiognomy and by a greater energy of
character; their features are not so flat, and their manners are
characterised by an ease and vivacity that form a strong contrast
with the heavy uncouthness of the Tartars.&nbsp; Merry-makings,
noisy songs, and joyous laughter animate their encampments, and
banish melancholy; but with this turn for gaiety and pleasure,
the Si-Fan are at the same time indomitably brave, and
exceedingly addicted to warfare.&nbsp; They accordingly manifest
the most profound contempt for the Chinese authority and
authorities, and though inscribed in the imperial list of
tributary nations, they absolutely refuse to render either
obedience or tribute.&nbsp; There are among them, indeed, several
tribes that constantly exercise their brigandage up to the very
frontiers of the empire, the Chinese mandarins never venturing to
encounter them.&nbsp; The Si-Fan are good horsemen, though not
equal to the Tartars.&nbsp; The care of their herds does not
prevent them from carrying on a little trade in the hair of their
cattle and the wool of their sheep.&nbsp; They weave a sort of
coarse linen, of which they make tents and clothing.&nbsp; When
they are assembled round their great pot of milk-tea, they give
themselves up, like the Tartars, to their gossiping humour, and
their passion for narratives of the adventures of Lamas and
brigands.&nbsp; Their memory is full of local anecdotes and
traditions; once put them on the track, and they will go on with
an interminable series of tales and legends.</p>
<p>One day, while our camels were tranquilly browsing some thorny
shrubs in the depths of the valley, we sought an asylum from the
north wind in a small tent, whence issued a thick smoke.&nbsp; We
found in it an old man who, knees and hands on the ground, was
puffing with all his might at a heap of argols which he had just
placed on the fire.&nbsp; We seated ourselves on a yak
skin.&nbsp; The old man crossed his legs, and held out his hand
to us.&nbsp; We gave him our tea-cups, which he filled with milk
tea, saying, &ldquo;Temouchi&rdquo; <!-- page 83--><a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>(drink in
peace).&nbsp; He then gazed at us, alternately, with an air of
some anxiety.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Aka</i> (brother),&rdquo; said we,
&ldquo;this is the first time we have come to seat ourselves in
your tent.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am old,&rdquo; he replied;
&ldquo;my legs will scarce sustain me; otherwise, I should have
come to Tchogortan to offer you my khata.&nbsp; According to what
the shepherds of the black tents have told me, you are from the
farther Western Heaven.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, our country is
far hence.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you from the kingdom of the
Samba, or from that of the Poba?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;From
neither; we come from the kingdom of the French.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ah, you are Franba?&nbsp; I never before heard of
them.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis such a great place, that West!&nbsp; The
kingdoms there are so numerous.&nbsp; But, after all, it matters
not: we are all of the same family, are we not?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes; assuredly all men are brothers, in whatever kingdom
each is born.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That is true: what you say is
founded on reason; all men are brothers.&nbsp; Yet we know that,
under heaven, there exist three great families: we men of the
west are all of the great Thibetian family, as I have
heard.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Aka, do you know whence come the three
great families that are beneath the heaven?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;This is what I have heard about it from Lamas learned in
the things of antiquity.&nbsp; In the beginning, there was on the
earth but one single man; he had neither house nor tent; for in
those days, winter was not cold nor summer hot; the wind did not
blow with violence, and there fell neither rain nor snow; tea
grew of itself on the mountains, and the cattle had nothing to
fear from maleficent animals.&nbsp; This man had three children,
who lived a long time with him, feeding upon milk and
fruits.&nbsp; After attaining a very great age, this man
died.&nbsp; The three children consulted what they should do with
the body of their father; they could not agree on the point, for
each had a different opinion.&nbsp; One of them wanted to put him
in a coffin, and bury him; the second proposed to burn him; the
third said it would be better to expose him on the top of a
mountain.&nbsp; In the end, they resolved to cut the body into
three pieces, to take each of them one piece, and then to
separate.&nbsp; The eldest had the head and arms for his share:
he was the ancestor of the great Chinese family; and this is why
his descendants have become celebrated in arts and industry, and
remarkable for their intelligence, and for the devices and
stratagems they can invent.&nbsp; The youngest, who was the
father of the great Thibetian family, had the chest and stomach
for his share, and this is why the Thibetians are full of heart
and courage, fearing not to encounter death, and ever having
among them indomitable tribes.&nbsp; The middle son, from whom
descend the Tartar peoples, received as his inheritance the lower
part of the body.&nbsp; You who have travelled much in the
deserts of the East, must know that the Mongols are <!-- page
84--><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>simple and timid, without head and without heart; their
only merit consisting in keeping themselves firm on their
stirrups, and solid on their saddles.&nbsp; This is how the Lamas
explain the origin of the three great families that are beneath
heaven, and the difference of their character.&nbsp; This is why
the Tartars are good horsemen, the Thibetians good soldiers, and
the Chinese good traders.&rdquo;&nbsp; As a return to the old man
for his interesting chronicle, we related to him the history of
the first man, Adam, of the Deluge, and of Noah and his three
children.&nbsp; He was at first extremely pleased to find in our
story also his three great families; but his surprise was
immense, when he heard us state that the Chinese, the Tartars,
and the Thibetians were all children of Shem, and that besides
these, there were innumerable nations who composed the two other
families of Cham and Japhet.&nbsp; He looked at us fixedly, his
mouth half open, and his head, from time to time, thrown up in
amazement, as much as to say: I never thought the world was so
big.</p>
<p>The time had passed rapidly during this arch&aelig;ological
sitting; so, after saluting the old man, we went to our camels,
which we drove home to Tchogortan, where, fastening them to a
stake at the door of our residence, we proceeded into our humble
kitchen to prepare our evening meal.</p>
<p>Culinarily speaking, we were far better off at Tchogortan than
at Kounboum.&nbsp; In the first place, we had milk, curds,
butter, and cheese, <i>&agrave; discretion</i>.&nbsp; Then we had
discovered a perfect mine, in a hunter of the vicinity.&nbsp; A
few days after our arrival, this Nimrod entered our room, and
taking a magnificent hare from a bag he carried at his back,
asked us whether the Goucho <a name="citation84"></a><a
href="#footnote84" class="citation">[84]</a> of the Western
Heaven ate the flesh of wild animals.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said we; &ldquo;and we consider hares
very nice.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you eat them?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We
laymen do, sometimes, but the Lamas, never.&nbsp; They are
expressly forbidden by the Book of Prayers to eat black
flesh.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The sacred law of Jehovah has
prescribed no such prohibition to us.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;In that
case keep the animal; and, as you like hares, I will bring you as
many of them every day as you please; the hills about Tchogortan
are completely covered with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just at this point, a Lama chanced to enter our
apartment.&nbsp; When he saw, stretched at our feet, the still
warm and bleeding form of the hare, &ldquo;Tsong-Kaba!&nbsp;
Tsong-Kaba!&rdquo; exclaimed he, starting back, with a gesture of
horror, and veiling his eyes with both hands.&nbsp; Then, after
launching a malediction against the poor hunter, he asked us
whether we should dare to eat that black flesh?&nbsp; &ldquo;Why
not,&rdquo; rejoined we, &ldquo;since it can injure neither our
<!-- page 85--><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>bodies nor our souls?&rdquo;&nbsp; And thereupon, we
laid down certain principles of morality, to the purport that the
eating of venison is, in itself, no obstacle to the acquisition
of sanctity.&nbsp; The hunter was highly delighted with our
dissertation: the Lama was altogether confounded.&nbsp; He
contented himself with saying, by way of reply, that in us, who
were foreigners and of the religion of Jehovah, it might be no
harm to eat hares; but that the Lamas must abstain from it,
because, if they failed to observe the prohibition and their
dereliction became known to the Grand Lama, they would be
pitilessly expelled from the Lamasery.</p>
<p>Our thesis having been thus victoriously sustained, we next
proceeded to entertain the proposition of the hunter, to provide
us every day with as many hares as we pleased.&nbsp; First, we
asked him whether he was in earnest.&nbsp; Upon his replying in
the affirmative, we told him that every morning he might bring us
a hare, but on the understanding that we were to pay him for
it.&nbsp; &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t sell hares here,&rdquo; replied
he; &ldquo;but since you will not accept them gratuitously, you
shall give me for each the value of a gun-charge.&rdquo;&nbsp; We
insisted upon a more liberal scale of remuneration, and, at last,
it was arranged that for every piece of game he brought us, we
should give him forty sapeks, equivalent to about four French
sous.</p>
<p>We decided upon eating hares for two reasons.&nbsp; First, as
a matter of conscience, in order to prevent the Lamas from
imagining that we permitted ourselves to be influenced by the
prejudices of the sectaries of Buddha; and, secondly, upon a
principle of economy; for a hare cost us infinitely less than our
insipid barley-meal.</p>
<p>One day, our indefatigable hunter brought us, instead of a
hare, an immense roebuck, which is also black flesh and
prohibited.&nbsp; In order not to compound in the least degree
with Buddhist superstitions, we purchased the roebuck, for the
sum of three hundred sapeks (thirty French sous.)&nbsp; Our
chimney smoked with venison preparations for eight consecutive
days, and all that time Samdadchiemba was in a most amiable frame
of mind.</p>
<p>Lest we should contract habits too exclusively carnivorous, we
resolved to introduce the vegetable kingdom into our quotidian
alimentation.&nbsp; In the desert, this was no easy matter.&nbsp;
However, by dint of industry, combined with experience, we
ultimately discovered some wild plants, which, dressed in a
particular manner, were by no means to be despised.&nbsp; We may
be permitted to enter into some details on this subject.&nbsp;
The matter in itself is of slight interest; but it may have its
use, in relation to travellers who at any future time may have to
traverse the deserts of Thibet.</p>
<p>When the first signs of germination begin to manifest <!--
page 86--><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>themselves, if you scratch up the ground to the depth of
about an inch, you will find quantities of creeping roots, long
and thin like dog-grass.&nbsp; This root is entirely covered with
little tubercles, filled with a very sweet liquid.&nbsp; In order
to make an extremely nice dish of this vegetable, you have only
to wash it carefully and then fry it in butter.&nbsp; Another
dish, not less distinguished in our esteem than the preceding,
was furnished by a plant very common in France, and the merit of
which has never yet been adequately appreciated: we refer to the
young stems of fern; when these are gathered quite tender, before
they are covered with down, and while the first leaves are bent
and rolled up in themselves, you have only to boil them in pure
water to realize a dish of delicious asparagus.&nbsp; If our
words were of any effect, we would earnestly recommend to the
attention of the Minister of Agriculture this precious vegetable,
which abounds, as yet to no purpose, on our mountains and in our
forests.&nbsp; We would also recommend to him the nettle
(<i>urtica urens</i>), which, in our opinion, might be made an
advantageous substitute for spinage; indeed, more than once, we
proved this by our own experience.&nbsp; The nettle should be
gathered quite young when the leaves are perfectly tender.&nbsp;
The plant should be pulled up whole, with a portion of the
root.&nbsp; In order to preserve your hands from the sharp biting
liquid which issues from the points, you should wrap them in
linen of close texture.&nbsp; When once the nettle is boiled, it
is perfectly innocuous, and this vegetable, so rough in its
exterior, then becomes a very delicate dish.</p>
<p>We were able to enjoy this delightful variety of esculents for
more than a month.&nbsp; Then, the little tubercles of the fern
became hollow and horny, and the stems themselves grew as hard as
wood; while the nettles, armed with a long white beard, presented
only a menacing and awful aspect.&nbsp; Later in the year, when
the season was more advanced, the perfumed strawberry of the
mountain and the white mushroom of the valley, became invaluable
substitutes for fern and nettle.&nbsp; But we had to wait a long
time for these luxuries, the cold in these countries being of
protracted duration, and the vegetation, of consequence,
exceedingly late.&nbsp; Throughout June there is snow still
falling, and the wind is so cold that you cannot, without
imprudence, throw aside your fur coats.&nbsp; With the first days
of July, the warmth of the sun begins to be felt, and the rain
falls in heavy showers; no sooner has the sky cleared up, than a
warm vapour rises from the earth, in surprising abundance.&nbsp;
You see it first skimming the surface of the valleys and the low
hills; then it condenses, and oscillates about somewhat above the
surface, becoming, by degrees, so thick that it obscures the
light of day.&nbsp; When this vapour has ascended high enough in
the air to <!-- page 87--><a name="page87"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 87</span>form great clouds, the south wind
rises, and the rain again pours down upon the earth.&nbsp; Then
the sky becomes clear once more, and once more the vapour rises
and rises, and so it goes on.&nbsp; These atmospheric revolutions
continue for a fortnight.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the earth is in a sort
of fermentation: all the animals keep crouching on the ground,
and men, women, and children feel, in every limb, vague,
indescribable discomfort and disability.&nbsp; The Si-Fan call
this period the season of land vapours.</p>
<p>Immediately that the crisis is past, the grass in the valley
grows visibly, and the mountains and hills around are covered, as
by enchantment, with flowers and verdure.&nbsp; The period was
also one of palingenesis for our camels.&nbsp; They became wholly
divested of their hair, which fell from them in large flakes,
like rags, and for a few days they were as bare as though they
had been closely shaved from the muzzle of the nose to the tip of
the tail.&nbsp; In this condition, they were perfectly
hideous.&nbsp; In the shade they shook with cold in every limb,
and at night we were obliged to cover them with great pieces of
felt to keep them from dying with cold.&nbsp; After four days had
elapsed, the hair began to re-appear.&nbsp; First, it was merely
a red down, extremely fine and curling, like lamb&rsquo;s
wool.&nbsp; The intense ugliness of the animals during their
state of nudity, made them appear perfectly beautiful in their
new attire, which was completed in a fortnight.&nbsp; Thus new
dressed, they rushed with ardour to the pasturages, in order to
get up respectable dimensions and adequate strength for their
autumnal journey.&nbsp; To sharpen their appetites, we had
purchased some sea salt, of which we gave them a large dose every
morning, before they went into the valley: and every evening, on
their return, we gave them another dose, to aid them to ruminate,
during the night, the immense mass of forage which they had
amassed in their stomachs during the day.</p>
<p>The new coating of our camels had enriched us with an immense
quantity of hair; we exchanged one-half of it for barley-meal,
and the question then arose, what was the best use we could make
of the remainder?&nbsp; A Lama, who was a skilful ropemaker,
suggested an excellent idea: he pointed out that during the long
journey through Thibet, we should need a large supply of cord
wherewith to fasten the luggage, and that ropes made of
camel&rsquo;s hair were, on account of their flexibility, the
best for cold countries.&nbsp; The suggestion, so full of wisdom,
was at once adopted.&nbsp; The Lama gave us, gratuitously, a few
lessons in his art, and we set to work.&nbsp; In a very short
time, we were able to twist our material tolerably well, so as to
give it a form approximately, at least, resembling rope.&nbsp;
Every day when we went out to tend our cattle, <!-- page 88--><a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>each of us
took under his arm a bundle of camel&rsquo;s hair, which on his
way he twisted into the smaller strings, that, on our return, we
combined into larger cords.</p>
<p>Samdadchiemba contented himself with looking on as we worked,
and with an occasional smile at our slips.&nbsp; Partly through
idleness, partly through vanity, he abstained from lending us a
hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;My spiritual fathers,&rdquo; said he, one day,
&ldquo;how can people of your quality demean yourselves by
rope-making?&nbsp; Would it not be much more proper to buy what
ropes you require, or to give the materials out to be made by
persons in the trade?&rdquo;&nbsp; This question afforded us an
opportunity of giving our cameleer a sound rating.&nbsp; After
having emphatically impressed upon him that we were in no
position to play the fine gentlemen, and that we must closely
study economy, we cited to him the example of St. Paul, who had
thought it no derogation from his dignity to labour with his
hands, in order to avoid being of charge to the faithful.&nbsp;
So soon as Samdadchiemba learned that St. Paul had been at the
same time a currier and an apostle, he forthwith abdicated his
idleness and his self-sufficiency, and applied himself with
ardour to rope-making.&nbsp; What was our astonishment, on seeing
the fellow at work, to find that he was a first-rate braider, for
not an inkling had he ever given us to that effect!&nbsp; He
selected the finest wool, and with it wove bridles and halters,
that were really quite masterpieces of art.&nbsp; It is almost
unnecessary to add that he was forthwith placed at the head of
our rope-making establishment, and that we submitted ourselves
altogether to his directorship.</p>
<p>The fine weather brought to Tchogortan a great number of
visitors from Kounboum, who sought at once change of air, and
temporary relaxation from their studies.&nbsp; Our apartment now
became a point of pilgrimage, for no one thought of spending a
day at Tchogortan without paying a visit to the Lamas of the
Western Heaven.&nbsp; Those Lamas, with whom we had formed a more
intimate acquaintance at Kounboum, and who had begun there to
inform themselves as to the truths of the Christian religion,
were attracted by a far higher motive than curiosity; they
desired to discourse further of the holy doctrine of Jehovah, and
to seek from us explanations of difficulties which had occurred
to them.&nbsp; Oh! how our hearts were penetrated with ineffable
joy when we heard these Buddhist monks pronounce with respect the
sacred names of Jesus and of Mary, and recite, with manifest
devotion, the prayers we had taught them.&nbsp; The great God, we
doubt not, will place to their favourable account, these first
steps in the path of salvation, and will not fail to send
shepherds to bring quite home to the fold these poor wandering
sheep.</p>
<p><!-- page 89--><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>Among the Lamas who came to recreate for awhile at
Tchogortan, we remarked especially a number of Tartar-Mongols,
who, bringing with them small tents, set them up in the valley
along the stream, or upon the sides of the most picturesque
hills.&nbsp; There they passed whole days revelling in the
delight of the independent life of the nomads, forgetting for
awhile, the constraint and confinement of the Lamanesque life, in
the enjoyment of the free life of the tent.&nbsp; You saw them
running and frolicking about the prairie like children, or
wrestling and exercising the other sports which recalled the days
and the land of their boyhood.&nbsp; The reaction with many of
these men became so strong, that even fixity of tent became
insupportable, and they would take it down and set it up again in
some other place, three or four times a day; or they would even
abandon it altogether, and taking their kitchen utensils and
their pails of water and their provisions on their shoulders,
would go, singing and dancing as they went, to boil their tea on
the summit of some mountain, from which they would not descend
till nightfall.</p>
<p>We observed, also, flocking to Tchogortan, another class of
Lamas not less interesting than the Mongols; they always arrived
at daybreak; their garments were tucked up to the knees, and on
their backs were large osier baskets; all day long they would
traverse the valley and the adjacent hills, collecting, not
strawberries and mushrooms, but the dung which the herds of the
Si-Fan deposit in all directions.&nbsp; On account of this
particular occupation, we named these Lamas Lama-Argoleers, from
the Tartar word argol, which designates animal excrement, when
dried and prepared for fuel.&nbsp; The Lamas who carry on this
class of business, are in general idle, irregular persons, who
prefer vagabondizing about on the hills to study and retirement;
they are divided into several companies, each working under the
direction of a superintendent, who arranges and is responsible
for their operations.&nbsp; Towards the close of the day, each
man brings the portion he has collected to the general depot,
which is always situate at the foot of some well, or in the
hollow of some valley.&nbsp; There the raw material is carefully
elaborated; it is pounded and moulded into cakes, which are
placed to dry in the sun, and when completely dessicated, are
symmetrically piled, one on the other, the stack, when formed,
being covered with a thick layer of dung, to protect it from the
dissolving action of the rain.&nbsp; In the winter, this fuel is
conveyed to Kounboum, and there sold.</p>
<p>The luxurious variety of combustibles which the civilized
nations of Europe enjoy, have exempted us from the necessity of
making any very profound researches into the divers qualities of
argols.&nbsp; Such has not been the case with the shepherd and
nomadic peoples.&nbsp; <!-- page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 90</span>Long experience has enabled them to
classify argols, with a perspicuity of appreciation which leaves
nothing to be desired in that particular respect.&nbsp; They have
established four grand divisions, to which future generations
will scarcely be able to apply any modification.</p>
<p>In the first rank are placed the argols of goats and sheep; a
glutinous substance that enters largely into its composition,
communicates to this combustible an elevation of temperature that
is truly astonishing.&nbsp; The Thibetians and Tartars use it in
the preparation of metals; a bar of iron, placed in a fire of
these argols, is soon brought to white heat.&nbsp; The residuum
deposited by the argols of goats and sheep after combustion, is a
sort of green vitreous matter, transparent, and brittle as glass,
which forms a mass full of cavities and very light; in many
respects, closely resembling pumice stone.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t
find in this residuum any ash whatever, unless the combustion has
been mixed with foreign matter.&nbsp; The argols of camels
constitute the second class; they burn easily, and throw out a
fine flame, but the heat they communicate is less vivid and less
intense than that given by the preceding.&nbsp; The reason of
this difference is, that they contain in combination a smaller
proportion of glutinous substance.&nbsp; The third class
comprehends the argols appertaining to the bovine species; these,
when thoroughly dry, burn readily, and produce no smoke
whatever.&nbsp; This is almost the only fuel you find in Tartary
and Thibet.&nbsp; Last come the argols of horses and other
animals of that family.&nbsp; These argols not having, like the
others, undergone the process of rumination, present nothing but
a mass of straw more or less triturated; they throw out a great
smoke when burning, and are almost immediately consumed.&nbsp;
They are useful, however, for lighting a fire, filling the office
of tinder and paper to the other combustibles.</p>
<p>We perfectly understand that this rapid and incomplete essay
on argols is not of a character to interest many readers; but we
did not feel justified in either omitting or abridging it,
because it has been an object with us to neglect no document that
might be of assistance to those who, after us, may venture upon
nomadic life for awhile.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of the valley of Tchogortan, though in the
apparent enjoyment of profound peace, are, nevertheless, an
incessant prey to the fear of the brigands, who, they informed
us, make periodical incursions from the mountains, and carry off
all the cattle they can find.&nbsp; It was stated that in 1842,
these had come in a large body, and devastated the whole of the
surrounding country.&nbsp; At a moment when they were least
expected, they issued from all <!-- page 91--><a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>the outlets
of the mountain, and spread over the valley, sending forth
fearful cries, and discharging their matchlocks.&nbsp; The
shepherds, terror-struck by this unforeseen attack, had not even
thought of the slightest resistance, but had fled in disorder,
carrying with them only that which they happened to lay their
hands upon at the moment.&nbsp; The brigands, profiting by this
panic fear, burned the tents, and collected, in one large
enclosure, formed with ropes, all the cattle and sheep they found
in and about the place.&nbsp; They then proceeded to the little
Lamasery of Tchogortan.&nbsp; But the Lamas had already
disappeared, with the exception of the hermits, who remained
perched on their nests on the rocks.&nbsp; The brigands carried
off or demolished everything they came to: they burned the idols
of Buddha, and broke down the dams that had been constructed for
the purpose of turning the praying-mills.&nbsp; Three years after
the event, we still saw the marked traces of their ferocious
devastations.&nbsp; The Buddhist temple, which had stood at the
foot of the mountain, had not been rebuilt.&nbsp; Its ruins,
blackened with their conflagrations, and some calcined portions
of the idols lay strewed upon the grass.&nbsp; The Lama hermits
were spared, indeed; but this, no doubt, was simply because the
brigands saw it would be too protracted and too arduous a labour
to achieve the tormenting them in their lofty and almost
inaccessible abodes.&nbsp; The excesses which they perpetrated
against the black tents and against the temple of Buddha itself,
showed that, if they left the poor recluses unscathed, it was by
no means from respect or compassion.</p>
<p>So soon as the news of the arrival of the brigands reached
Kounboum, the whole Lamasery was afoot, and in commotion.&nbsp;
The Lamas rushed to arms with loud vociferations.&nbsp; They
caught up whatever in the shape of a weapon first came to hand,
and dashed off, confusedly, towards the Lamasery of
Tchogortan.&nbsp; But they arrived there too late; the brigands
had disappeared, carrying off all the flocks and herds of the
Si-Fan, and leaving behind them in the valley nothing but smoking
ruins.</p>
<p>The shepherds who, since this event, had returned and set up
their tents amidst the pasturages of Tchogortan, were always on
the watch, fearful of a new aggression.&nbsp; From time to time
some of them, armed with lances and guns, would patrol the
neighbourhood; a precaution which, though it would certainly have
by no means intimidated the brigands, had at least the advantage
of communicating a certain degree of fancied security to the
population.</p>
<p>Towards the end of August, while we were quietly occupied in
the manufacture of our ropes, sinister rumours began to
circulate; by degrees they assumed all the character of certain
intelligence <!-- page 92--><a name="page92"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 92</span>
<a href="images/p92.jpg">
<img class='clearcenter' alt=

</a> and no doubt was entertained that we were threatened with a
new and terrible invasion of brigands.&nbsp; Every day we were
alarmed with some fresh fact of a formidable nature.&nbsp; The
shepherds of such a place had been surprised, their tents burned,
and their flocks driven off.&nbsp; Elsewhere there had been a
tremendous battle, in which a number of persons had been
killed.&nbsp; These rumours became so substantially alarming,
that the administrators of the Lamasery felt bound to adopt some
measures on the subject.&nbsp; They dispatched to Tchogortan a
Grand Lama and twenty students of the Faculty of Prayers, charged
with the task of preserving the locality from any unpleasant
occurrence.&nbsp; On their arrival, these Lamas convoked the
chiefs of the Si-Fan families, and announced that now they were
come, the people had nothing to fear.&nbsp; Next morning, they
all ascended the highest mountain in the neighbourhood, set up
some travelling tents there, and proceeded to recite prayers to
the accompaniment of music.&nbsp; They remained in this
encampment <!-- page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 93</span>two whole days, which they occupied
in praying, in exorcising, and in constructing a small pyramid of
earth, whitened with lime, and above which floated, at the end of
a mast, a flag on which were printed various Thibetian
prayers.&nbsp; This modest edifice was entitled the Pyramid of
Peace.&nbsp; These ceremonies completed, the Lamas, great and
small, folded their tents, descended from the mountain, and
quietly returned to Kounboum, fully persuaded that they had
opposed to the brigands an impassable barrier.</p>
<p>The Pyramid of Peace did not appear, however, to have infused
equal confidence into the hearts of the herdsmen; for, one fine
morning, they all decamped together, bag and baggage, and went
with their herds and flocks to seek a less dangerous position
elsewhere.&nbsp; They invited us to follow their example, but we
preferred to remain where we were, for in the desert there is
scarcely one place more secure than another.&nbsp; The flight of
the shepherds, besides, seemed to us a guarantee that our
tranquillity would not be disturbed, for we considered that the
brigands, when they learned that no flocks remained in the valley
of Tchogortan, would feel no interest in paying us a visit.&nbsp;
We therefore, in our turn, raised up in our hearts a Pyramid of
Peace, in the form of a firm reliance on the divine protection;
and, thus fortified, we abode calmly and fearlessly in our
adopted home.</p>
<p>For some days we enjoyed the most profound solitude.&nbsp;
Since the disappearance of the herds and flocks, the argoleers,
having nothing to do, had kept away.&nbsp; We were alone with a
Lama, left in charge of the Lamasery.&nbsp; Our animals profited
by the change, for now all the pasturages of the valley were
theirs; they could browse wherever they liked over the valley,
fearless of meeting a single competitor.</p>
<p>The desert, however, became after a time, once more alive, and
towards the commencement of September, the Lamas of the Faculty
of Medicine repaired to Tchogortan, for the purpose of
botanizing.&nbsp; The disposable houses received all they could
contain, and the rest dwelt in tents, sheltered by the great
trees of the Lamasery.&nbsp; Every morning, after they have
recited their prayers in common, drunk their buttered tea, and
eaten their barley-meal, all the students in medicine tuck up
their garments, and go forth on the mountains, under the guidance
of one of their professors.&nbsp; They are each provided with a
long iron-pointed stick, and a small pick-axe; a leathern bag,
filled with meal, is suspended from the girdle, and some carry at
their backs great tea-kettles, for the Faculty spend the entire
day on the mountain.&nbsp; Before sunset, the Lama physicians
return laden with perfect faggots of branches, and piles of
plants and grasses.&nbsp; As you see them weariedly <!-- page
94--><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>descending the mountains, supported by their long staves
and bearing these burdens, they look more like poaching
woodcutters than like future doctors in medicine.&nbsp; We were
often obliged to escort in person those of the number who had
special charge of the aromatic plants; for our camels, which,
attracted by the odour, always put themselves in pursuit of these
personages, would otherwise inevitably, and without the smallest
scruple, have devoured those precious simples, destined for the
relief of suffering humanity.&nbsp; The remainder of the day is
occupied in cleaning and spreading out on mats these various
products of the vegetable kingdom.&nbsp; The medical harvest
lasted eight whole days.&nbsp; Five other days are devoted to the
selection and classification of the various articles.&nbsp; On
the fourteenth day, a small portion is given to each student, the
great bulk remaining the property of the Faculty of
Medicine.&nbsp; The fifteenth day is kept as a festival, in the
form of a grand banquet of tea with milk, barley-meal, little
cakes fried in butter, and boiled mutton.&nbsp; Thus terminates
this botanico-medical expedition, and the illustrious Faculty
gaily returns to the Grand Lamasery.</p>
<p>The drugs collected at Tchogortan are deposited in the general
drug-room of Kounboum.&nbsp; When they have been thoroughly dried
in the heat of a moderate fire, they are reduced to powder, and
then divided into small doses, which are neatly enveloped in red
paper, and labelled with Thibetian characters.&nbsp; The pilgrims
who visit Kounboum, buy these remedies at exorbitant
prices.&nbsp; The Tartar-Mongols never return home without an
ample supply of them, having an unlimited confidence in whatever
emanates from Kounboum.&nbsp; On their own mountains and prairies
they would find exactly the same plants, the same shrubs, the
same roots, the same grasses; but then how different must be the
plants, shrubs, roots, and grasses that grow and ripen in the
birth-place of Tsong-Kaba!</p>
<p>The Thibetian physicians are as empirical as those of other
countries&mdash;possibly somewhat more so.&nbsp; They assign to
the human frame forty hundred and forty maladies, neither more
nor less.&nbsp; The books which the Lamas of the Faculty of
Medicine are obliged to study and to learn by heart, treat of
these four hundred and forty maladies, indicating their
characteristics, the means of identifying them, and the manner of
combating them.&nbsp; These books are a hotch-potch of aphorisms,
more or less obscure, and of a host of special recipes.&nbsp; The
Lama physicians have not so great a horror of blood as the
Chinese physicians have&mdash;they bleed sometimes, and cup
often.&nbsp; In the latter operation, they first subject the skin
of the part to slight excoriations; and afterwards place over it
a bullock&rsquo;s horn, open at the point.&nbsp; They exhaust
<!-- page 95--><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>the air within, and when a sufficient vacuum is
obtained, stop up the hole with a pellet of chewed paper.&nbsp;
When they wish to remove the cup they have only to remove this
mastic.</p>
<p>The Lama physicians attach extreme importance to the
inspection of the patient&rsquo;s water.&nbsp; They always
require various specimens of it, collected at different hours of
the day and night.&nbsp; They examine it with the most minute
attention, and take the greatest heed to all the changes
undergone by its colour.&nbsp; They whip it, from time to time,
with a wooden spatula, and then put it up to the ear to ascertain
what degree, if any, of noise it makes; for in their view, a
patient&rsquo;s water is mute or silent, according to his state
of health.&nbsp; A Lama physician, to attain the character of
thorough ability in his profession, must be able to treat and
cure a patient without having ever seen him, the inspection of
the water sufficing as a guide in the preparation of his
prescriptions.</p>
<p>As we have said elsewhere, in speaking of the Tartar-Mongols,
the Lamas introduce many superstitious practices into
medicine.&nbsp; Yet, notwithstanding all this quackery, there is
no doubt that they possess an infinite number of very valuable
recipes, the result of long experience.&nbsp; It were, perhaps,
rash to imagine that medical science has nothing to learn from
the Tartar, Thibetian, and Chinese physicians, on the pretext
that they are not acquainted with the structure and mechanism of
the human body.&nbsp; They may, nevertheless, be in possession of
very important secrets, which science alone, no doubt, is capable
of explaining, but which, very possibly, science itself may never
discover.&nbsp; Without being scientific, a man may very well
light upon extremely scientific results.&nbsp; In China, Tartary,
and Thibet, everybody can make gunpowder; yet it may be safely
propounded that not one of these powder-makers can explain
scientifically this chemical operation; each man has a good
receipt for making the powder, and he makes it.</p>
<p>Towards September, we received the joyful intelligence that
the Thibetian embassy had arrived at Tang-Keou-Eul, where it was
to remain for several days, in order to lay in a stock of
provisions, and arrange its order of march.&nbsp; Thus, then,
after long and annoying delay, we were about to proceed to the
capital of Thibet.&nbsp; We made, without loss of time, all our
necessary preparations.&nbsp; First we had to pay a visit to
Kounboum, in order to purchase provisions for four months, since,
on the whole route, there was not the least hope of finding any
thing to buy that we might want.&nbsp; Upon a careful
calculation, we found that we should require five bricks of tea,
two sheep&rsquo;s paunches of butter, two sacks of flour, and
eight sacks of tsamba.&nbsp; Tsamba is the name given here to
barley-meal, the insipid article which constitutes the <!-- page
96--><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>ordinary food of the Thibetians.&nbsp; They take a
tea-cup half filled with boiling tea; to this they add some
pinches of tsamba, and then mix these materials together with the
finger, into a sort of wretched paste, neither cooked nor
uncooked, hot nor cold, which is then swallowed, and is
considered breakfast, dinner, or supper, as the case may
be.&nbsp; If you desire to cross the desert to Lha-Ssa, you must
perforce resign yourself to tsamba; &rsquo;tis to no avail the
French traveller sighs for his accustomed knife and fork, and his
accustomed knife and fork dishes: he must do without them.</p>
<p>Persons, full of experience and philanthropy, counselled us to
lay in a good store of garlic, and every day to chew several
cloves of it, unless we wished to be killed on our way by the
deleterious vapours, that emanated from certain elevated
mountains.&nbsp; We did not discuss the merits of this hygeianic
advice, but adopted it with absolute confidingness.</p>
<p>Our residence in the valley of Tchogortan had been in a high
degree advantageous to our animals, which had become fatter than
we had ever before known them; the camels, in particular, were
magnificently stout; their humps, made firm with solid flesh,
rose proudly on their backs, and seemed to defy the fatigues and
privations of the desert.&nbsp; Still, even in their improved
condition, three camels were not enough to carry our provisions
and our baggage.&nbsp; We accordingly added to our caravan a
supplementary camel and horse, which lightened our exchequer to
the extent of twenty-five ounces of silver; moreover, we hired a
young Lama of the Ratchico mountains, with whom we had become
acquainted at Kounboum, and who was admitted into our party in
the capacity of pro-cameleer.&nbsp; This appointment, while it
raised the social condition of Samdadchiemba, diminished also the
fatigues of his functions.&nbsp; According to this new
arrangement, the little caravan was disposed in the following
order: the pro-cameleer, Charadchambeul, went on foot, and led
after him the four camels, who marched in Indian file, the one
fastened to the tail of the other; Samdadchiemba,
cameleer-in-chief, rode his little black mule beside the camels,
and the two missionaries closed the procession, each mounted on a
white horse.&nbsp; After having exchanged infinite khatas with
our acquaintance and friends at Kounboum and Tchogortan, we
proceeded on our route, directing our march towards the Blue Sea,
where we were to await the Thibetian embassy.</p>
<p>From Tchogortan to the Koukou-Noor was four days&rsquo;
march.&nbsp; We passed on our way a small Lamasery, called
Tansan, containing at most two hundred Lamas; its site is
perfectly enchanting; rocky mountains, covered with shrubs and
tall firs, form for it a circular enclosure, in the centre of
which rise the habitations of the <!-- page 97--><a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>Lamas.&nbsp;
A stream, bordered with willows and fine longwort, after
tranquilly encircling the Lamasery, dashes over a rocky fall, and
continues its course in the desert.&nbsp; The Buddhist monastery
of Tansan is, they say, very rich, being largely endowed by the
Mongol princes of Koukou-Noor with annual contributions.</p>
<p>On leaving the Lamasery of Tansan, we entered an extensive
plain, where numerous Mongol tents and flocks of every kind
picturesquely variegated the verdure of the pastures.&nbsp; We
met two Lamas on horseback, who were seeking contributions of
butter from the wealthy shepherds of the locality.&nbsp; Their
course is this: they present themselves at the entrance of each
tent, and thrice sound a marine conch.&nbsp; Thereupon, some
member of the family brings out a small roll of butter, which,
without saying a word, he deposits in a bag, suspended from the
saddle of each Lama&rsquo;s horse.&nbsp; The Lamas never once
alight, but content themselves with riding up to each tent, and
announcing their presence to the inmates by the sound of the
shell.</p>
<p>As we advanced, the country became more fertile and less
mountainous, until at length, we reached the vast and magnificent
pasturage of Koukou-Noor.&nbsp; There vegetation is so vigorous,
that the grass rose up to the stomachs of our camels.&nbsp; Soon
we discovered, far before us, quite in the horizon, what seemed a
broad silver riband, above which floated light vapours that,
rising, became lost in the azure of the heavens.&nbsp; Our
pro-cameleer informed us that this was the Blue Sea.&nbsp; His
words filled us with a tremulous joy; we urged on our animals,
and the sun had not set when we planted our tent within a hundred
paces of the waters of the great Lake.</p>

<p>The Blue Lake, in Mongol Koukou-Noor, in Thibetian
Tsot-Ngon-Po, was anciently called by the Chinese Si-Ha&iuml;
(Western Sea); they now call it Tsing-Ha&iuml; (Blue Sea).&nbsp;
This immense reservoir of water, which is more than a hundred
leagues in circumference, seems, in fact, to merit the title of
sea, rather than merely that of lake.&nbsp; To say nothing of its
vast extent, it is to be remarked <!-- page 99--><a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>that its
waters are bitter and salt, like those of the ocean, and undergo,
in a similar manner, flux and reflux.&nbsp; The marine odour
which they exhale is smelt at a great distance, far into the
desert.</p>
<p>Towards the western portion of the Blue Sea there is a small
island, rocky and bare, inhabited by twenty contemplative Lamas,
who have built thereon a Buddhist temple, and some modest
habitations, wherein they pass their lives, in tranquil
retirement, far from the distracting disquietudes of the
world.&nbsp; No one can go and visit them, for, throughout the
entire extent of the lake, there is not a single boat of any kind
to be seen; at all events we saw none, and the Mongols told us
that among their tribes no one ever thought of occupying himself
in any way or degree with navigation.&nbsp; In the winter,
indeed, at the time of the more intense cold, the water is frozen
solidly enough to enable the shepherds around to repair in
pilgrimage to the Lamasery.&nbsp; They bear to the contemplative
Lamas their modest offerings of butter, tea, and tsamba, and
receive in exchange, benedictions and prayers for good pasturage
and prosperous flocks.</p>
<p>The tribes of the Koukou-Noor are divided into twenty-nine
banners, commanded by three Kiun-Wang, two Be&iuml;l&eacute;, two
Be&iuml;ss&eacute;, four Koung, and eighteen Ta&iuml;-Tsi.&nbsp;
All these princes are tributaries of the Chinese emperor, and,
every second year, repair to Peking, whither they carry, as
tribute, furs and gold-dust, which their subjects collect from
the sands of their rivers.&nbsp; The vast plains which adjoin the
Blue Sea are of very great fertility and of a most agreeable
aspect, though entirely destitute of trees; the grass is of
prodigious height, and the numerous streams which fertilize the
soil, afford ample means to the numerous herds of the desert for
satiating their thirst.&nbsp; The Mongols, accordingly, are very
fond of setting up their tents in these magnificent
pastures.&nbsp; The hordes of brigands harass them in vain; they
will not quit the country.&nbsp; They content themselves with a
frequent change of encampment, in order to baffle their enemies,
but when they can no longer avoid the danger they encounter it
with great bravery, and fight gallantly.&nbsp; The necessity
under which they permanently exist of defending their property
and their lives from the attacks of the Si-Fan, has, at length,
rendered them intrepidly courageous.&nbsp; At any hour of the day
or night they are ready for battle: they tend their cattle on
horseback, lance in hand, fusil in sling, and sabre in
belt.&nbsp; What a difference between these vigorous shepherds,
with their long moustaches, and the languishing fiddle-fuddles of
Virgil, eternally occupied in piping on a flute, or in decorating
with ribands and flowers their pretty straw hats.</p>
<p>The brigands, who keep the Mongol tribes of the Koukou-Noor
<!-- page 100--><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>always on the alert, are hordes of Si-Fan, or Eastern
Thibetians, dwelling in the Bayen-Kharat mountains, towards the
sources of the Yellow River.&nbsp; In this part of the country
they are known under the generic appellation of Kolo.&nbsp; Their
peculiar haunt, it is said, are the deep gorges of the mountain,
whither it is impossible to penetrate without a guide, for all
the approaches are guarded by impassable torrents and frightful
precipices.&nbsp; The Kolos never quit these abodes except to
scour the desert on a mission of pillage and devastation.&nbsp;
Their religion is Buddhism; but they have a special idol of their
own, whom they designate the Divinity of Brigandism, and who,
assuredly, enjoys their most intense devotion, their most genuine
worship.&nbsp; The chief business of their Lamas is to pray and
offer up sacrifices for the success of their predatory
expeditions.&nbsp; It is said that these brigands are in the
revolting habit of eating the hearts of their prisoners, in order
to fortify their own courage; but, for that matter, there is no
monstrous practice which the Mongols of the Koukou-Noor do not
unhesitatingly attribute to these people.</p>
<p>The Kolos are divided into several tribes, each bearing a
particular name of its own; and it was only in the nomenclature
of these tribes that we ever, in this part of the world, heard of
the Khalmouks, or Calmucks.&nbsp; That which we, in Europe,
ordinarily conceive to be Khalmoukia, is a purely imaginary
distinction; the Khalmouks are very far indeed from enjoying, in
Asia, the importance which our books of geography assign to
them.&nbsp; In the Khalmoukia of our imagining, no one ever heard
of the Khalmouks.&nbsp; It was a long time before we could even
discover the existence of the name at all; but, at last, we were
lucky enough to meet with a Lama who had travelled extensively in
Eastern Thibet, and he told us that among the Kolo, there is a
small tribe called Kolo-Khalmouki.&nbsp; It is just possible that
at some former period the Khalmouks may have enjoyed great
importance, and have occupied a large extent of country; but the
great probability, at least, is, that it was the travellers of
the thirteenth century, who, relying upon some vague notions they
had picked up, represented this petty tribe to be a great
nation.</p>
<p>Neither does the Koukou-Noor country itself merit the
importance given to it in our geographies: it occupies, in the
maps, a far greater space than it really possesses.&nbsp; Though
comprising twenty-nine banners, its limits are restricted: on the
north it is bordered by Khilian-Chan, on the south by the Yellow
River, on the east by the province of Kan-Sou, on the west by the
river Tsaidam, where begins another Tartar country, inhabited by
tribes who bear the designation of Mongols of the Tsaidam.</p>
<p><!-- page 101--><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>According to the popular traditions of the Koukou-Noor,
the Blue Sea did not always occupy its present site: that great
mass of water originally covered, in Thibet, the place where the
city of Lha-Ssa now stands.&nbsp; One fine day it abandoned its
immense reservoir there, and, by a subterranean march, travelled
to the place which now serves as its bed.&nbsp; The following is
the narrative of this marvellous event that was related to
us.</p>
<p>In ancient times the Thibetians of the kingdom of Oui resolved
to build a temple in the centre of the great valley which they
inhabited; they collected, at vast expense, the richest
materials, and the edifice rose rapidly; but, just on the point
of completion, it suddenly crumbled to pieces, without any one
having the least idea as to the cause of this disaster.&nbsp;
Next year they made new preparations, and laboured upon the
construction of the temple with equal ardour; the second temple,
when just completed, fell to pieces as the first had done; a
third attempt was made, the only result of which was a third
catastrophe, exactly the same with the two preceding.&nbsp; Every
body was plunged in utter despair, and there was talk of
abandoning the enterprize.&nbsp; The king consulted a famous
diviner of the country, who replied that it had not been given to
him to know the cause which opposed the construction of the
temple, but this he knew: that there was a great saint in the
East who possessed a certain secret, which secret, being once
extracted from him, the obstacle would forthwith disappear.&nbsp;
He could, however, give no exact information as to who the great
saint was, or where he lived.&nbsp; After protracted
deliberation, a Lama, of excellent address and great courage, was
sent on a mission of inquiry.&nbsp; He traversed all the
districts east of the kingdom of Oui; he visited the Tartar
tribes, stopping for awhile wherever he heard speak of any man
especially noted for his sanctity and knowledge.&nbsp; All his
inquiries were fruitless: it was to no purpose he discoursed of
the valley of the kingdom of Oui, and of the temple which it had
been attempted to raise there: nobody comprehended at all what he
was talking about.&nbsp; He was returning home, depressed and
disappointed, when, in crossing the great plains which separate
Thibet from China, the girth of his saddle broke, and he fell
from his horse.&nbsp; Perceiving, near at hand, beside a small
pond, a poor, dilapidated tent, he proceeded thither to get his
saddle repaired.&nbsp; Having fastened his horse to a stake at
the door of the tent, he entered and found within a venerable old
man, absorbed in prayer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; said the
traveller, &ldquo;may peace be ever in thy dwelling.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; replied the old man, without moving,
&ldquo;seat thyself beside my hearth.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Thibetian
Lama fancied he saw that the old man was blind.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
perceive, with <!-- page 102--><a name="page102"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 102</span>grief,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that
thou hast lost the use of thy eyes.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes;
&rsquo;tis now many years since I was deprived of the happiness
of contemplating the brightness of the sun, and the verdure of
our beautiful plains; but prayer is a great consolation in my
affliction.&nbsp; Brother, it seems to me that thy tongue has a
peculiar accent: art thou not a man of our tribes?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am a poor Lama of the East.&nbsp; I made a vow to visit
the temples that have been raised in the Mongol countries, and to
prostrate myself before the sainted personages I should meet on
my way.&nbsp; An accident has happened to me near this spot; I
have broken the girth of my saddle, and I have come to thy tent
to mend it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am blind,&rdquo; said the old
man; &ldquo;I cannot myself help thee; but look round the tent,
there are several straps, and thou canst take that which will
best answer thy purpose.&rdquo;&nbsp; While the stranger was
selecting a good strap, wherewith to make a new girth, the old
man spoke: &ldquo;O Lama of eastern lands; happy art thou to be
able to pass thy days visiting our sacred monuments!&nbsp; The
most magnificent temples are in the Mongol countries; the Poba
(Thibetians) will never attain anything like them: &rsquo;tis in
vain they apply their utmost efforts to build such in their
beautiful valley; the foundations they put will always be sapped
by the waves of a subterranean sea, of which they do not suspect
the existence.&rdquo;&nbsp; After a moment&rsquo;s silence the
old man added: &ldquo;I have uttered these words because thou art
a Mongol Lama; but thou must lock them up in thy heart, and never
communicate them to a single person.&nbsp; If, in thy
pilgrimages, thou meetest a Lama of the kingdom of Oui, guard
well thy tongue, for the revealing my secret will cause the ruin
of our country.&nbsp; When a Lama of the kingdom of Oui shall
know that in his valley there exists a subterranean sea, the
waters of that sea will forthwith depart thence, and inundate our
prairies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had scarcely uttered the last word, when the stranger rose
and said to him, &ldquo;Unfortunate old man, save thyself, save
thyself in haste: the waters will speedily be here, for I am a
Lama of the kingdom of Oui.&rdquo;&nbsp; So saying, he jumped on
his horse, and disappeared over the desert.</p>
<p>These words struck like a thunderbolt upon the poor old
man.&nbsp; After a moment of dull stupor he gave way to cries and
groans.&nbsp; While yielding to this excess of grief his son
arrived, bringing home from pasture a small herd of cattle.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My son,&rdquo; cried the old man, &ldquo;saddle thy horse
on the instant, take thy sabre, and gallop off towards the West:
thou wilt overtake a foreign Lama, whom thou must kill, for he
has stolen from me my strap.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How!&rdquo;
exclaimed the young man, terror-struck, &ldquo;wouldst thou have
me commit a murder?&nbsp; Wouldst thou, my father, whom all our
tribes <!-- page 103--><a name="page103"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 103</span>venerate for thy great sanctity,
order me to kill a poor traveller, because he took from thy tent
a strap of which he had, doubtless, need?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Go,
go, my son, hasten, I conjure thee,&rdquo; cried the old man,
throwing his arms about in despair; &ldquo;go and immolate that
stranger, unless thou wouldst have us all buried beneath the
waves.&rdquo;&nbsp; The young man, believing that his father
laboured under a temporary fit of insanity, would not contradict
him, lest he should exasperate him still more; he therefore
mounted his horse and galloped after the Lama of the kingdom of
Oui.&nbsp; He came up with him before the evening: &ldquo;Holy
personage,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;pardon me, that I interrupt
your progress; this morning you rested in our tent, and you took
thence a strap, which my father is making a great outcry for; the
fury of the old man is so excessive, that he has ordered me to
put you to death; but it is no more permissible to execute the
orders of a raving old man than it is to fulfil those of a
child.&nbsp; Give me back the strap, and I will return to appease
my father.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Lama of the kingdom of Oui
dismounted, took off the girth of his saddle, and gave it to the
young man, saying, &ldquo;Your father gave me this strap, but,
since he regrets the gift, carry it back to him; old men are
fanciful, but we must, nevertheless, respect them, and carefully
avoid occasioning them any annoyance.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Lama took
off his own girdle, made a saddle-girth of it, and departed, the
young man returning in all haste to his tent.</p>
<p>He arrived in the night time, and found his dwelling
surrounded by a multitude of shepherds, who, unable to comprehend
the lamentations of the great saint of their district, were
awaiting, in much anxiety, the return of his son.&nbsp; &ldquo;My
father, my father,&rdquo; cried the young man, dismounting,
&ldquo;be calm, here is what thou wantedst.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;And the stranger?&rdquo; asked the old man, &ldquo;hast
thou put him to death?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I let him depart in
peace for his own country.&nbsp; Should I not have committed a
great crime, had I murdered a Lama who had done you no
evil?&nbsp; Here is the strap he took from you.&rdquo;&nbsp; And,
so saying, he put the strap into his father&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp;
The old man shuddered in every limb, for he saw that his son had
been overreached: the same word in Mongol signifies both strap
and secret.&nbsp; The old man had meant that his son should kill
the man who had stolen his secret from him: but when he saw that
his son brought back to him a strap, he cried &ldquo;The West
triumphs; &rsquo;tis the will of heaven!&rdquo;&nbsp; He then
told the shepherds to flee with their cattle and sheep in all
haste, unless they desired to be swallowed up by the
waters.&nbsp; As to himself, he prostrated himself in the centre
of his tent and there resignedly awaited death.</p>
<p><!-- page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>Day had scarce dawned when there was heard underground
a rumbling but majestic sound, similar to the tumult of torrents
rolling their waves over the mountain sides.&nbsp; The sound
advanced with fearful rapidity, and the water of the pond, beside
which the old man lived, was seen to be in great commotion: then
the earth opened with terrible shocks, and the subterranean
waters rose impetuously, and spread, like a vast sea, over the
plain, destroying infinite numbers of men and beasts who had not
time to escape.&nbsp; The old man was the first who perished
beneath the waves.</p>
<p>The Lama, who bore the secret of this great catastrophe, upon
arriving in the kingdom of Oui, found his countrymen in utter
consternation at fearful sounds they had heard beneath them in
the valley, and the nature and cause of which no one could
explain.&nbsp; He related the story of the blind old man, and all
immediately comprehended that the uproar which had so alarmed
them had been occasioned by the subterranean sea, on its removal
to the East.&nbsp; They resumed, with enthusiasm, the labours of
construction they had abandoned, and raised a magnificent temple,
which is still standing.&nbsp; An immense number of families
settled around the temple, and, by degrees, there was created a
great city, which took the name of Lha-Ssa (Land of Spirits).</p>
<p>This singular chronicle of the origin of the Blue Sea was
first related to us in Koukou-Noor; it was afterwards repeated to
us at Lha-Ssa, in almost precisely the same terms; but we could
nowhere discover traces of any historical fact with which the
singular fable might be supposed to correspond.</p>
<p>We abode in Koukou-Noor for nearly a month.&nbsp; Continual
rumours of the brigands compelled us to move our encampment five
or six times, in order to follow the Tartar tribes, who, at the
least suggestion of approaching assailants, change their
quarters, taking care, however, never to remove altogether from
the rich pastures which border the Blue Sea.</p>
<p>Towards the end of October, the Thibetian embassy arrived, and
we joined the immense body, already swollen on its previous way
by a great number of Mongol caravans, which, like ourselves,
availed themselves of this favourable escort to Lha-Ssa.&nbsp;
Formerly, the Thibetian government sent an embassy every year to
Peking.&nbsp; That of 1840 was attacked on its journey by a large
body of Kolos.&nbsp; The engagement lasted a whole day, but, in
the end, the Thibetians were victorious over their assailants,
and continued their journey.&nbsp; Next morning, however, it was
discovered that they had no longer amongst them the
Tchanak-Kampo, <a name="citation104"></a><a href="#footnote104"
class="citation">[104]</a> a Grand Lama, who <!-- page 105--><a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>accompanies
these embassies to Peking, in the character of representative of
the Tal&eacute;-Lama.&nbsp; For several days he was sought all
around, but to no effect, and the only conclusion was that during
the fight he had been taken prisoner by the Kolos, and carried
off.&nbsp; The embassy, however, proceeded on its way, and
arrived at Peking without its official head.&nbsp; The emperor,
of course, was tremendously afflicted.</p>
<p>In 1841, there was another battle with the brigands, and
another catastrophe.&nbsp; This time, the Tchanak-Kampo was not
carried off by the brigands, but he received from them a gash in
the chest, of which he died in a few days afterwards.&nbsp; The
emperor, on hearing these melancholy tidings, was, it is
affirmed, altogether inconsolable, and forthwith sent dispatches
to the Tal&eacute;-Lama, setting forth that, considering the
difficulties and dangers of the journey, he would henceforth
require the compliment of an embassy only once in three
years.&nbsp; Accordingly, the present embassy was the first which
had been dispatched from Lha-Ssa since 1841.&nbsp; On its journey
out it had been fortunate enough to encounter no brigands, and,
consequently, its Tchanak-Kampo had been neither stolen nor
stabbed.</p>
<p>Next day, after our departure from Koukou-Noor, we placed
ourselves at the van of the caravan, and then halted on one side,
in order to see the immense procession defile before us, and so
make acquaintance with our travelling companions.&nbsp; The men
and animals composing the caravan might be thus estimated: 1500
long-haired oxen, 1200 horses, 1200 camels, and 2000 men,
Thibetians and Tartars, some on foot, some on ox-back, but most
of them on horses and camels.&nbsp; All the cavalry were armed
with lances, sabres, bows and arrows, and matchlocks.&nbsp; The
foot-men, designated Lakto, were charged with the conduct of the
files of camels and of the capricious and disorderly march of the
cattle.&nbsp; The Tchanak-Kampo travelled in a large litter,
carried by two mules.&nbsp; Besides this multitude, whose journey
extended to Lha-Ssa, there was an escort of 300 Chinese soldiers,
furnished by the province of Kan-Sou, and 200 brave Tartars,
charged by the princes of Koukou-Noor, with the protection of the
holy embassy of the Tal&eacute;-Lama, to the frontiers of
Thibet.</p>
<p>The soldiers of the province of Kan-Sou fulfilled their
functions like thorough Chinese.&nbsp; In order to avoid any
disagreeable encounter, they carefully kept at the rear of the
caravan, where they sang, smoked, and joked at their ease, giving
no sort of heed to any possible brigands.&nbsp; Every day they
exhibited the remarkable peculiarity of waiting until the rest of
the caravan had filed off, when they carefully searched all over
the night&rsquo;s encampment in <!-- page 106--><a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>order to
pick up anything that might have been left behind, and, of
course, travelling somewhat in the rear of the rest, they were
further able to realize any matters that those preceding them
might drop during the progress of the day.&nbsp; The Tartar
soldiers pursued a conduct precisely the reverse: they were ever
in the van, and at the sides of the caravan, dashing about to the
tops of the hills and the depths of the valleys to see that no
ambush of brigands lay in wait there.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

src="images/p106.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The general march and particular movements of the caravan were
executed with tolerable order and precision, especially at the
outset.&nbsp; Generally, we started every morning two or three
hours before sunrise, in order that we might encamp about noon,
and give the animals full time to feed during the remainder of
the day; the reveill&eacute; was announced by a cannon shot;
forthwith, everybody rose, the fires were lighted, and while some
of each particular party loaded the beasts of burden, the others
boiled the kettle and prepared breakfast; a few cups of tea were
drunk, a few handfuls of tsamba eaten, and then the tent was
taken down, and <!-- page 107--><a name="page107"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 107</span>packed.&nbsp; A second cannon-shot
gave the signal for departure.&nbsp; A few of the more
experienced horsemen took the lead as guides; these were followed
by long files of camels, and then came the long-haired cattle, in
herds of two or three hundred beasts each, under the care of
several lakto.&nbsp; The horsemen had no fixed place in the
procession; they dashed here and there, up and down, just as
their caprice suggested.&nbsp; The plaintive cries of the camels,
the roaring of the bulls, the lowing of the cows, the neighing of
the horses, the talking, bawling, laughing, singing of the
travellers, the whistling of the lakto to the beasts of burden,
and, above all, the innumerable bells tinkling from the necks of
the yaks and the camels, produced together an immense,
undefinable concert, which, far from wearying, seemed, on the
contrary, to inspire everybody with fresh courage and energy.</p>
<p>The caravan went on thus across the desert, stopping each day
in plains, in valleys, and on the mountain sides, improvising,
with its tents, so numerous and so varied in form and colour, a
large town, which vanished each morning, to reappear further on
each evening.&nbsp; What an astonishing thing it must have been
for these vast and silent deserts, to find themselves, all of a
sudden, traversed by so numerous and so noisy a multitude!&nbsp;
When we viewed those infinite travelling tents, those large
herds, and those men, in turns shepherds and warriors, we could
not help frequently reflecting upon the march of the Israelites,
when they went in search of the Promised Land, through the
solitudes of Median.</p>
<p>On quitting the shore of the Blue Sea, we directed our steps
towards the west, with a slight inclination, perhaps,
southward.&nbsp; The first days of our march were perfect poetry;
everything was just as we could have wished; the weather was
magnificent, the road excellent, the water pure, the pastures
rich and ample.&nbsp; As to brigands, we lost all thought of
them.&nbsp; In the night, it was, indeed, rather cold; but this
inconvenience was easily obviated by the aid of our sheep-skin
coats.&nbsp; We asked one another what people could mean by
representing this Thibet journey as something so formidable; it
seemed to us impossible for any one to travel more comfortably,
or more agreeably.&nbsp; Alas! this enchantment was not of long
duration.</p>
<p>Six days after our departure, we had to cross the Pouhain-Gol,
a river which derives its source from the slopes of the Nan-Chan
mountains, and throws itself into the Blue Sea.&nbsp; Its waters
are not very deep, but being distributed in some dozen channels,
very close to one another, they occupy altogether a breadth of
more than a league.&nbsp; We had the misfortune to reach the
first branch of the Pouhain-Gol long before daybreak; the water
was frozen, <!-- page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 108</span>but not thickly enough to serve as a
bridge.&nbsp; The horses which arrived first grew alarmed and
would not advance; they stopped on the bank, and gave the cattle
time to come up with them.&nbsp; The whole caravan thus became
assembled at one point, and it would be impossible to describe
the disorder and confusion which prevailed in that enormous mass,
amid the darkness of night.&nbsp; At last, several horsemen,
pushing on their steeds and breaking the ice, actually and
figuratively, the whole caravan followed in their train: the ice
cracked in all directions, the animals stumbled about and
splashed up the water, and the men shouted and vociferated; the
tumult was absolutely fearful.&nbsp; After having traversed the
first branch of the river, we had to man&oelig;uvre, in the same
way, over the second, and then over the third, and so on.&nbsp;
When day broke, the Holy Embassy was still dabbling in the water:
at length, after infinite fatigue and infinite quaking, physical
and moral, we had the delight to leave behind us the twelve arms
of the Pouhain-Gol, and to find ourselves on dry land; but all
our poetical visions had vanished, and we began to think this
manner of travelling perfectly detestable.</p>
<p>And yet everybody about us was in a state of jubilation,
exclaiming that the passage of the Pouhain-Gol had been admirably
executed.&nbsp; Only one man had broken his legs, and only two
animals had been drowned.&nbsp; As to the articles lost or
stolen, during the protracted disorder, no one took any heed to
them.</p>
<p>When the caravan resumed its accustomed march, it presented a
truly ludicrous appearance.&nbsp; Men and animals were all, more
or less, covered with icicles.&nbsp; The horses walked on, very
dolefully, evidently much incommoded by their tails, which hung
down, all in a mass, stiff and motionless, as though they had
been made of lead instead of hair.&nbsp; The long hair on the
legs of the camels had become magnificent icicles, which knocked
one against the other, as the animals advanced, with harmonious
discord.&nbsp; It was very manifest, however, that these fine
ornaments were not at all to the wearers&rsquo; taste, for they
endeavoured, from time to time, to shake them off by stamping
violently on the ground.&nbsp; As to the long-haired oxen, they
were regular caricatures; nothing can be conceived more ludicrous
than their appearance, as they slowly advanced, with legs
separated to the utmost possible width, in order to admit of an
enormous system of stalactites which hung from their bellies to
the ground.&nbsp; The poor brutes had been rendered so perfectly
shapeless by the agglomeration of icicles with which they were
covered, that they looked as though they were preserved in
sugar-candy.</p>
<p>During the first few days of our march we were somewhat <!--
page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>isolated and lonely amid the multitude; without friends
or even acquaintance.&nbsp; However, we soon acquired companions,
for there is nothing like travelling to bring men together.&nbsp;
The companions whom we entered into association with, and beside
whose tent we each day set up our own, were neither merchants,
nor pilgrims, nor members of the embassy itself, nor simple
travellers, like ourselves; they were four Lamas, who constituted
a category altogether apart.&nbsp; Two of them were from Lha-Ssa,
one from Further Thibet, and the fourth from the kingdom of
Torgot.&nbsp; On our way, they related to us their long and
picturesque history, of which the following is an outline.</p>
<p>The three Thibetian Lamas had become the disciples of a Grand
Lama, named Alt&egrave;re, who proposed to erect, in the vicinity
of Lha-Ssa, a Buddhist temple, which, in extent and magnificence,
was to surpass all those previously existing.&nbsp; One day he
announced to his three disciples that all his plans were formed,
and that they must all now proceed upon a grand quest for
subscriptions wherewith to defray the enormous expenses of the
sacred construction.&nbsp; They accordingly all four set forth,
with hearts full of zeal and devotion.&nbsp; They first directed
their steps towards the north, and traversing all Central Asia,
reached the kingdom of Torgot, close to the Russian
frontier.&nbsp; On their way, they called at all the Lamaseries,
and at the abode of all the Thibetian and Tartar princes that lay
near the route.&nbsp; Everywhere, they received considerable
offerings, for, besides that their object was of itself
calculated to excite the warmest interest in well-disposed minds,
Alt&egrave;re-Lama had letters of recommendation from the
Tal&eacute;-Lama, from the Bandchan-Remboutchi, and from the
heads of all the most famous Lamaseries of Thibet.&nbsp; In
Torgot, a rich Mongol Lama, touched with the devotion of these
intrepid collectors, offered them all his herds, and entreated
Alt&egrave;re-Lama to admit him among his disciples, so that he
might aid them in their mission through the countries of
Tartary.&nbsp; Alt&egrave;re-Lama, on his part, moved with a zeal
so pure, a disinterestedness so entire, consented to accept both
his offerings and himself.&nbsp; The Lama collectors thus became
five in number.</p>
<p>From Torgot they directed their march towards the east, going
from one tribe to another, and everywhere augmenting their herds
of cattle, sheep, and horses.&nbsp; On their way they passed
through the country of the Khalkhas, where they stayed for some
time in the Lamasery of the Great Kouren, the offerings of the
Tartar pilgrims flowing in abundantly.&nbsp; Hence, they turned
south, to Peking, where they converted into gold and silver the
innumerable animals which they had collected together from all
parts.&nbsp; After an <!-- page 110--><a name="page110"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 110</span>extended residence in the capital of
the Chinese empire, they resumed their operations in the deserts
of Tartary, and still seeking subscriptions, and still receiving
them, arrived at Kounboum.&nbsp; In this famous and sainted
Lamasery, capable of appreciating the merit of good Lamas, the
zeal and devotion of the celebrated questors attained a colossal
reputation; they became the objects of the public veneration, and
the professors, who aimed at perfection in their pupils, proposed
to them these five men as models.</p>
<p>Alt&egrave;re-Lama, after three years of so meritorious a
quest, now only sighed for the hour when he should return to
Lha-Ssa and consecrate to the construction of his temple all the
rich offerings he had succeeded in collecting.&nbsp; Great,
therefore, was his joy, when he heard the intelligence that the
Thibetian embassy was at hand.&nbsp; He resolved to avail himself
of its escort, on its return from Peking, so as securely to
convey his gold and his silver through the dangerous district of
the Kolo.&nbsp; Meanwhile, he announced, he would apply all his
attention to the preparations required for this important
journey.</p>
<p>But, alas! the projects of men are often frustrated at the
very moment when they seem on the point of succeeding in the most
triumphant manner.&nbsp; One fine day there arrived at
Si-Ning-Fou an imperial courier extraordinary, bearing dispatches
by which the Grand Mandarin of that town was ordered to arrange
with the superior of the Lamasery of Kounboum, for the immediate
arrest of Alt&egrave;re-Lama, charged with having, during the
past three years, committed the most comprehensive swindling, by
means of certain letters of recommendation, falsely attributed to
the Tal&eacute;-Lama.&nbsp; The orders of his imperial majesty
were executed.&nbsp; One may easily imagine the stupifaction, on
the occasion, of the poor Alt&egrave;re-Lama, and especially of
his four disciples, who throughout the affair, had acted with the
most entire good faith.&nbsp; The very embassy, on the protection
of which Alt&egrave;re-Lama had so relied, was directed by the
Thibetian government to take charge of the Grand Questor, whose
marvellous successes had been published at Lha-Ssa, by the
indiscreet laudations of the pilgrims.</p>
<p>Alt&egrave;re-Lama, having been arrested on the spot, was
immediately forwarded, under safe escort, to Lha-Ssa, the route
taken by his guard being that of the imperial couriers, through
the province of Sse-Tchouan.&nbsp; Upon his arrival in the
capital of Thibet, his case was to be investigated by his natural
judges.&nbsp; Meanwhile, his prodigious receipts were confiscated
to the benefit of the Tal&eacute;-Lama; for, obviously, nothing
could be more just than that he should be placed in possession of
the gold and the silver which had been raised under the
all-potent influence of his name.&nbsp; As to the <!-- page
111--><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>Grand Questor&rsquo;s four disciples, it was arranged
that they should await the return of the Thibetian embassy, and
proceed with it to Lha-Ssa, taking with them fifty-eight
magnificent camels which the Alt&egrave;re-Lama had procured, and
which were to be at the disposal of the Thibetian government.</p>
<p>These four unfortunate disciples were the travelling
companions whom good fortune had thrown in our way.&nbsp; The
recollection of their fallen master was ever in their minds, but
the sentiments which that recollection excited in them were not
always the same.&nbsp; Sometimes they regarded their master as a
saint, sometimes as a swindler; one day they would pronounce his
name with veneration, raising their clasped hands to their
forehead; another day, they would curse him, and spit in the air,
to show their contempt for him.&nbsp; The Lama of Torgot,
however, always made the best of the matter.&nbsp; He reproached
himself, sometimes, for having made an offering of all his herds
to a man who now developed, pretty manifestly, every appearance
of a rogue; but still he consoled himself that after all the
man&rsquo;s knavery had been the occasion of his seeing a good
deal of the world, and visiting the most celebrated
Lamaseries.&nbsp; These four young men were excellent fellows,
and capital travelling companions.&nbsp; Every day they gave us
some fresh details of their varied adventures, and their
narratives frequently contributed to make us forget, for awhile,
the fatigues and miseries of the journey.</p>
<p>A permanent cause of the sufferings we had to endure was our
pro-cameleer Charadchambeul.&nbsp; At first, this young Lama
appeared to us a budding saint, but before long, we found that we
had got amongst us a complete little demon with a human
face.&nbsp; The following adventure opened our eyes to his
character, and showed us what we should have to endure on his
account.</p>
<p>The day after the passage of the Pouhain-Gol, when we had been
marching for a part of the night, we remarked, on one of our
camels, two great packages, carefully enveloped in wrappers,
which we had not before seen.&nbsp; We thought, however, that
some traveller, who had not been able to find room for them on
his own sumpter animal, had asked Charadchambeul to take charge
of them during the journey; and we, accordingly, quietly pursued
our way, without, at the time, recurring to the
circumstance.&nbsp; When we reached our encampment for the night,
so soon as the baggage was taken down, we saw, to our great
surprise, our Lama of the Ratchico mountains take the two
packets, envelope them mysteriously in a piece of felt, and hide
them in a corner of the tent.&nbsp; There was evidently something
here which required explanation; and we accordingly desired
Charadchambeul to inform us what was this <!-- page 112--><a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>new luggage
that we saw in the tent.&nbsp; He approached us, and in a whisper
as though fearing to be heard, told us that during the night
Buddha had bestowed on him a special grace, in enabling him to
find on the road a good thing, and then he added, with a knavish
smile, that at Lha-Ssa, this good thing would sell for at least
ten ounces of silver.&nbsp; We frowned, and required to see this
same good thing.&nbsp; Charadchambeul, having first carefully
closed the door of the tent, uncovered, with infinite emotion,
his pretended godsend.&nbsp; It consisted of two great leathern
jars, full of a sort of brandy, that is distilled in the province
of Kan-Sou, and which is sold at a high price.&nbsp; On these two
jars were Thibetian characters indicating the well known name of
the proprietor.&nbsp; We had the charity to reject the thought
that Charadchambeul had stolen these jars, during the night; and
preferred to suppose that he had picked them up on the
road.&nbsp; But our pro-cameleer was a casuist of very loose
morality.&nbsp; He pretended that the jars belonged to him, that
Buddha had made him a present of them, and that all which now
required to be done was carefully to conceal them, lest the
previous proprietor should discover them.&nbsp; Any attempt to
reason such a worthy as this into morality and justice, would
have been simply lost labour and time.&nbsp; We therefore
emphatically declared to him that the jars were neither
our&rsquo;s nor his, that we would neither receive them into our
tent nor place them on our camels during the journey, and that we
had no desire whatever to arrive at Lha-Ssa with the character of
being thieves.&nbsp; And in order that he might labour under no
sort of misconception as to our feelings, we added, that unless
he forthwith removed the jars from our tent, we should instantly
proceed and give information of the circumstance to the
proprietor.&nbsp; He seemed somewhat shaken by this intimation,
and in order effectually to induce him to restitution, we advised
him to carry what he had &ldquo;found&rdquo; to the ambassador,
and request him to return it to the owner.&nbsp; The
Tchanak-Kampo, we said, would not fail to be affected by his
probity, and even if he did not give him a reward in hand, would
bear him in mind, and when we reached Lha-Ssa would doubtless
benefit him in some way.&nbsp; After an animated opposition, this
advice was adopted.&nbsp; Charadchambeul presented himself before
the Tchanak-Kampo, who said to him, on receiving the jars:
&ldquo;Thou art a good Lama.&nbsp; A Lama who has justice in his
heart, is acceptable to the spirits.&rdquo;&nbsp; Charadchambeul
returned perfectly furious, vehemently exclaiming that we had
induced him to commit an imbecility in giving up the jars to the
ambassador, who had presented him with nothing in return but
empty words.&nbsp; From that moment he vowed an implacable hatred
towards us.&nbsp; He did his work <!-- page 113--><a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>how and
when he pleased; he took a delight in wasting our provisions;
every day he loaded us with abuse, and in his rage often turning
upon the poor animals, he would beat them about the head till he
had half killed them.&nbsp; To discharge the wretch there, amid
the desert, was impossible.&nbsp; We were fain therefore to arm
ourselves with patience and resignation, and to avoid irritating
still more the man&rsquo;s untamed ferocity.</p>
<p>Five days after the passage of the Pouhain-Gol, we reached
Toulain-Gol, a narrow, shallow river, which we crossed without
any difficulty.&nbsp; The caravan halted shortly afterwards near
a Lamasery, which had the appearance of former prosperity, but
which was, at present, wholly deserted.&nbsp; The temples and the
Lamas cells, all tumbling in pieces, had become the abode of bats
and of enormous rats.&nbsp; We heard that this Buddhist
monastery, after having been besieged for three days by the
brigands, had been taken by them, the greater portion of the
inmates massacred, and the place itself plundered and
demolished.&nbsp; From that time forth, no Lama had ventured to
settle in the spot.&nbsp; The vicinity, however, was not so
entirely uninhabited as we at first supposed.&nbsp; In walking
over some rocky hills close by, we found a herd of goats and
three miserable tents, concealed in a ravine.&nbsp; The poor
inmates came out and begged for a few leaves of tea and a little
tsamba.&nbsp; Their eyes were hollow, and their features pale and
haggard.&nbsp; They knew not, they said, where to take refuge, so
as to live in peace.&nbsp; The fear of the brigands was so
powerful over them, that it divested them even of the courage to
flee away.</p>
<p>Next day the caravan continued its route, but the Chinese
escort remained encamped on the bank of the river; its task was
completed, and after a few days rest, it would return home.&nbsp;
The Thibetian merchants, so far from being distressed at the
circumstance, said that now the Chinese soldiers were no longer
with them, they should be able to sleep at night, freed from the
fear of thieves.</p>
<p>On the 15th November, we quitted the magnificent plains of the
Koukou-Noor, and entered upon the territory of the Mongols of
Tsaidam.&nbsp; Immediately after crossing the river of that name,
we found the aspect of the country totally changed.&nbsp; Nature
becomes all of a sudden savage and sad; the soil, arid and stony,
produces with difficulty a few dry, saltpetrous bushes.&nbsp; The
morose and melancholy tinge of these dismal regions seems to have
had its full influence upon the character of its inhabitants, who
are all evidently a prey to the spleen.&nbsp; They say very
little, and their language is so rude and guttural that other
Mongols can scarcely understand them.&nbsp; Mineral salt and
borax abound on this arid and almost wholly pastureless
soil.&nbsp; You dig holes two or three feet deep, and the salt
<!-- page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>collects therein, and crystallizes and purifies of
itself, without your having to take any trouble in the
matter.&nbsp; The borax is collected from small reservoirs, which
become completely full of it.&nbsp; The Thibetians carry
quantities of it into their own country, where they sell it to
the goldsmiths, who apply it to facilitate the fusion of
metals.&nbsp; We stayed two days in the land of Tsaidam, feasting
upon tsamba and some goats which the shepherds gave in exchange
for some bricks of tea.&nbsp; The long-tailed oxen and the camels
regaled themselves with the nitre and salt which they had every
where about for the picking up.&nbsp; The grand object with the
whole caravan was to get up its strength as much as possible,
with a view to the passage of the Bourhan-Bota, a mountain noted
for the pestilential vapours in which, as we were informed, it is
constantly enveloped.</p>
<p>We started at three in the morning, and after infinite
sinuosities and meanderings over this hilly country, we arrived,
by nine o&rsquo;clock, at the foot of the Bourhan-Bota.&nbsp;
There the caravan halted for a moment, as if to poise its
strength; everybody measured, with his eyes, the steep and rugged
paths of the lofty ascent, gazed with anxiety at a light, thin
vapour, which we were told was the pestilential vapour in
question, and for awhile the entire party was completely
depressed and discouraged.&nbsp; After having taken the hygeianic
measures prescribed by tradition, and which consist in
masticating two or three cloves of garlic, we began to clamber up
the side of the mountain.&nbsp; Before long, the horses refused
to carry their riders, and all, men as well as animals, advanced
on foot, and step by step; by degrees, our faces grew pale, our
hearts sick, and our legs incapable of supporting us; we threw
ourselves on the ground, then rose again to make another effort;
then once more prostrated ourselves, and again rose to stumble on
some paces farther; in this deplorable fashion was it that we
ascended the famous Bourhan-Bota.&nbsp; Heavens! what
wretchedness it was we went through; one&rsquo;s strength seemed
exhausted, one&rsquo;s head turning round, one&rsquo;s limbs
dislocated; it was just like a thoroughly bad sea-sickness; and
yet, all the while, one has to retain enough energy, not only to
drag one&rsquo;s self on, but, moreover, to keep thrashing the
animals which lie down at every step, and can hardly be got to
move.&nbsp; One portion of the caravan, as a measure of
precaution, stopped half way up the mountain, in a gully where
the pestilential vapours, they said, were not so dense; the other
portion of the caravan, equally as a measure of precaution,
exerted their most intense efforts in order to make their way
right up to the top, so as to avoid being asphyxiated by that
dreadful air, so completely charged with carbonic acid.&nbsp; We
were of the number <!-- page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 115</span>of those who ascended the
Bourhan-Bota at one stretch.&nbsp; On reaching its summit, our
lungs dilated at their ease.&nbsp; The descent of the mountain
was mere child&rsquo;s play, and we were soon able to set up our
tent far from the murderous air we had encountered on the
ascent.</p>
<p>The Bourhan-Bota mountain has this remarkable particularity,
that the deleterious vapour for which it is noted, is only found
on the sides facing the east and the north; elsewhere, the air of
the mountain is perfectly pure and respirable.&nbsp; The
pestilential vapours themselves would appear to be nothing more
than carbonic acid gas.&nbsp; The people attached to the embassy
told us that when there is any wind, the vapours are scarcely
perceptible, but that they are very dangerous when the weather is
calm and serene.&nbsp; Carbonic acid gas being, as the reader is
aware, heavier than the atmospheric air, necessarily condenses on
the surface of the ground, and remains fixed there until some
great agitation of the air sets it in movement, disperses it in
the atmosphere, and neutralizes its effects.&nbsp; When we
crossed the Bourhan-Bota, the weather was rather calm than
otherwise.&nbsp; We remarked, that when we were lying on the
ground, respiration was much more difficult; when, on the
contrary, we raised ourselves on horseback, the influence of the
gas was scarcely felt.&nbsp; The presence of the carbonic acid
rendered it very difficult to light a fire; the argols burned
without flame, and threw out great quantities of smoke.&nbsp; As
to the manner in which the gas is formed, or as to whence it
comes, we can give no sort of idea.&nbsp; We will merely add, for
the benefit of those who are fond of seeking explanations of
things in their names, that Bourhan-Bota means Kitchen of
Bourhan; Bourhan being a synonyme of Buddha.</p>
<p>During the night we passed on the other side of the mountain,
there fell a frightful quantity of snow.&nbsp; Our companions,
who had not ventured to ascend the entire mountain at once,
rejoined us in the morning; they informed us that they had
effected the ascent of the upper portion of the mountain easily
enough, the snow having dispersed the vapour.</p>
<p>The passage of the Bourhan-Bota was but a sort of
apprenticeship.&nbsp; A few days after, Mount Chuga put our
strength and courage to a still more formidable test.&nbsp; The
day&rsquo;s march being long and laborious, the cannon shot, our
signal for departure, was heard at one o&rsquo;clock in the
morning.&nbsp; We made our tea with melted snow, ate a good meal
of tsamba, seasoned with a clove of garlic, cut up into small
bits, and started.&nbsp; When the huge caravan first set itself
in motion, the sky was clear, and a brilliant moon lit up the
great carpet of snow with which the whole country was
covered.&nbsp; Mount Chuga being not very steep in the direction
<!-- page 116--><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>where we approached it, we were able to attain the
summit by sunrise.&nbsp; Almost immediately afterwards, however,
the sky became thickly overcast with clouds, and the wind began
to blow with a violence which grew constantly more and more
intense.&nbsp; The opposite sides of the mountain we found so
encumbered with snow, that the animals were up to their girths in
it; they could only advance by a series of convulsive efforts,
which threw several of them into gulfs from which it was
impossible to extricate them, and where they accordingly
perished.&nbsp; We marched in the very teeth of a wind so strong
and so icy, that it absolutely at times choked our respiration,
and despite our thick furs, made us tremble lest we should be
killed with the cold.&nbsp; In order to avoid the whirlwinds of
snow which the wind perpetually dashed in our faces, we adopted
the example of some of our fellow travellers, who bestrode their
horses&rsquo; backs with their faces to the tail, leaving the
animals to follow the guidance of their instinct.&nbsp; When we
reached the foot of the mountain, and could use our eyes, we
found that more than one face had been frozen in the
descent.&nbsp; Poor M. Gabet, among the rest, had to deplore the
temporary decease of his nose and ears.&nbsp; Everybody&rsquo;s
skin was more or less chapped and cut.</p>
<p>The caravan halted at the foot of Mount Chuga, and each member
of it sought refuge for awhile in the labyrinths of a number of
adjacent defiles.&nbsp; Exhausted with hunger, and our limbs
thoroughly benumbed, what we wanted to bring us to, was a good
fire, a good supper, and a good well-warmed bed; but the Chuga is
far from possessing the comfortable features of the Alps; no
Buddhist monks have as yet bethought themselves of taking up
their abode there for the solace and salvation of poor
travellers.&nbsp; We were, consequently, fain to set up our tent
amid the snow, and then to go in search of what argols we could
burn.&nbsp; It was a spectacle worthy of all pity to see that
multitude, wandering about in all directions, and rummaging up
the snow, in the hope of lighting upon some charming thick bed of
argols.&nbsp; For ourselves, after long and laborious research,
we managed to collect just enough of the article to melt three
great lumps of ice, which we extracted by aid of a hatchet, from
an adjacent pond.&nbsp; Our fire not being strong enough to boil
the kettle, we had to content ourselves with infusing our tsamba
in some tepid water, and gulping it down in order to prevent its
freezing in our hands.&nbsp; Such was all the supper we had after
our frightful day&rsquo;s journey.&nbsp; We then rolled ourselves
up in our goat-skins and blankets, and, crouching in a corner of
the tent, awaited the cannon-shot that was to summon us to our
delightful <i>Impressions de Voyage</i>.</p>
<p>We left in this picturesque and enchanting encampment, the
<!-- page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>Tartar soldiers who had escorted us since our departure
from Koukou-Noor; they were no longer able to extend to us their
generous protection, for, that very day, we were about to quit
Tartary, and to enter the territory of Hither Thibet.&nbsp; The
Chinese and Tartar soldiers having thus left us, the embassy had
now only to rely upon its own internal resources.&nbsp; As we
have already stated, this great body of 2,000 men was completely
armed, and everyone, with the merest exception, had announced
himself prepared to show himself, upon occasion, a good
soldier.&nbsp; But some how or other the whilome so martial and
valorous air of the caravan had become singularly modified since
the passage of the Bourhan-Bota.&nbsp; Nobody sang now, nobody
joked, nobody laughed, nobody pranced about on his horse;
everybody was dull and silent; the moustaches which heretofore
had been so fiercely turned up, were now humbly veiled beneath
the lamb-skins with which all our faces were covered up to the
eyes.&nbsp; All our gallant soldiers had made up their lances,
fusils, sabres, bows and arrows, into bundles, which were packed
upon their sumpter animals.&nbsp; For that matter, the fear of
being killed by the brigands scarcely occurred now to any one:
the point was to avoid being killed by the cold.</p>
<p>It was on Mount Chuga that the long train of our real miseries
really began.&nbsp; The snow, the wind, and the cold there set to
work upon us, with a fury which daily increased.&nbsp; The
deserts of Thibet are certainly the most frightful country that
it is possible to conceive.&nbsp; The ground continuing to rise,
vegetation diminished as we advanced, and the cold grew more and
more intense.&nbsp; Death now hovered over the unfortunate
caravan.&nbsp; The want of water and of pasturage soon destroyed
the strength of our animals.&nbsp; Each day we had to abandon
beasts of burden that could drag themselves on no further.&nbsp;
The turn of the men came somewhat later.&nbsp; The aspect of the
road was of dismal auspice.&nbsp; For several days, we travelled
through what seemed the excavations of a great cemetery.&nbsp;
Human bones, and the carcases of animals presenting themselves at
every step, seemed to warn us that, in this fatal region, amidst
this savage nature, the caravans which had preceded us, had
preceded us in death.</p>
<p>To complete our misery, M. Gabet fell ill, his health
abandoning him just at the moment when the frightful difficulties
of the route called for redoubled energy and courage.&nbsp; The
excessive cold he had undergone on the passage of Mount Chuga,
had entirely broken up his strength.&nbsp; To regain his previous
vigour, he needed repose, tonic drinks, and a substantial
nourishment, whereas all we had to give him was barley-meal, and
tea made with snow water; and, moreover, notwithstanding his
extreme weakness, he <!-- page 118--><a name="page118"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 118</span>had every day to ride on horseback,
and to struggle against an iron climate.&nbsp; And we had two
months more of this travelling before us, in the depth of
winter.&nbsp; Our prospect was, indeed, sombre!</p>
<p>Towards the commencement of September, we arrived in sight of
the Bayen-Kharat, a famous chain of mountains, extending from
south-east to north-west, between the Hoang-Ho and the
Kin-Cha-Kiang.&nbsp; These two great rivers, after running a
parallel course on either side of the Bayen-Kharat, then separate
and take opposite directions, the one towards the north, the
other towards the south.&nbsp; After a thousand capricious
meanderings in Tartary and Thibet, they both enter the Chinese
empire; and after having watered it from west to east, they
approach each other, towards their mouths, and fall into the
Yellow Sea very nearly together.&nbsp; The point at which we
crossed the Bayen-Kharat is not far from the sources of the
Yellow River; they lay on our left, and a couple of days&rsquo;
journey would have enabled us to visit them; but this was by no
means the season for pleasure trips.&nbsp; We had no fancy for a
tourist&rsquo;s excursion to the sources of the Yellow River: how
to cross the Bayen-Kharat was ample occupation for our
thoughts.</p>
<p>From its foot to its summit the mountain was completely
enveloped in a thick coat of snow.&nbsp; Before undertaking the
ascent, the principal members of the embassy held a
council.&nbsp; The question was not whether they should pass the
mountain: if they desired to reach Lha-Ssa, the passage of the
mountain was an essential preliminary; nor was it the question,
whether they should await the melting of the snow; the point was
simply whether it would be more advantageous to ascend the
mountain at once or to wait till next day.&nbsp; The fear of
avalanches filled every one&rsquo;s mind, and we should all have
gladly subscribed to effect an assurance against the wind.&nbsp;
After the example of all the councils in the world, the council
of the Thibetian embassy was soon divided into two parties, the
one contending that it would be better to start forthwith, the
other insisting that we ought, by all means, to wait till the
morrow.</p>
<p>To extricate themselves from this embarrassment, they had
recourse to the Lamas, who had the reputation of being
diviners.&nbsp; But this expedient did not combine all minds in
unity.&nbsp; Among the diviners there were some who declared that
this day would be calm, but that the next day there would be a
terrible wind, and there were others who announced an exactly
contrary opinion.&nbsp; The caravan thus became divided into two
camps, that of movement and that of non-movement.&nbsp; It will
at once be understood that in our character of French citizens,
we instinctively placed ourselves in the ranks of the
progressists; that is to say, of those <!-- page 119--><a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>who desired
to advance, and to have done with this villainous mountain as
soon as possible.&nbsp; It appeared to us, moreover, that reason
was altogether on our side.&nbsp; The weather just then was
perfectly calm; but we knew not what it might be on the
morrow.&nbsp; Our party, therefore, proceeded to scale these
mountains of snow, sometimes on horseback, but more frequently on
foot.&nbsp; In the latter case, we made our animals precede us,
and we hung on to their tails, a mode of ascending mountains
which is certainly the least fatiguing of all.&nbsp; M. Gabet
suffered dreadfully, but God, of his infinite goodness, gave us
strength and energy enough to reach the other side.&nbsp; The
weather was calm throughout, and we were assailed by no avalanche
whatever.</p>
<p>Next morning, at daybreak, the party who had remained behind,
advanced and crossed the mountain with entire success.&nbsp; As
we had had the politeness to wait for them, they joined us, and
we entered together a valley where the temperature was
comparatively mild.&nbsp; The excellence of the pasturage induced
the caravan to take a day&rsquo;s rest here.&nbsp; A deep lake,
in the ice of which we dug wells, supplied us with abundance of
water.&nbsp; We had plenty of fuel, too, for the embassies and
pilgrimages being in the habit of halting in the valley, after
the passage of the Bayen-Kharat, one is always sure to find
plenty of argols there.&nbsp; We all kept up great fires
throughout our stay, burning all the burnable things we could
find, without the smallest consideration for our successors,
leaving it to our 15,000 long-haired oxen to supply the
deficit.</p>
<p>We quitted the great valley of Bayen-Kharat, and set up our
tents on the banks of the Mourou&iuml;-Oussou, or, as the
Thibetians call it, Polei-Tchou (river of the Lord.)&nbsp;
Towards its source, this magnificent river bears the name of
Mourou&iuml;-Oussou (tortuous river); further on it is called
Kin-Cha-Kiang (river of golden sand), and arrived in the province
of Sse-Tchouan, it becomes the famous Yang-Dze-Kiang (blue
river.)&nbsp; As we were passing the Mourou&iuml;-Oussou, on the
ice, a singular spectacle presented itself.&nbsp; We had
previously, from our encampment, observed dark, shapeless masses,
ranged across this great river; and it was not until we came
quite close to these fantastic islets that we could at all make
head or tail of them.&nbsp; Then we found out that they were
neither more nor less than upwards of fifty wild cattle,
absolutely encrusted in the ice.&nbsp; They had no doubt
attempted to swim across the river, at the precise moment of the
concretion of the waters, and had been so hemmed in by the flakes
as to be unable to extricate themselves.&nbsp; Their fine heads,
surmounted with great horns, were still above the surface; the
rest of the bodies was enclosed by the ice, which was so
transparent as to give a full view of the form and position of
<!-- page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>the unlucky animals, which looked as though they were
still swimming.&nbsp; The eagles and crows had pecked out their
eyes.</p>
<p>Wild cattle are of frequent occurrence in the deserts of
Hither Thibet.&nbsp; They always live in great herds, and prefer
the summits of the mountains.&nbsp; During the summer, indeed,
they descend into the valleys in order to quench their thirst in
the streams and ponds; but throughout the long winter season,
they remain on the heights feeding on snow, and on a very hard
rough grass they find there.&nbsp; These animals, which are of
enormous size, with long black hair, are especially remarkable
for the immense dimensions and splendid form of their
horns.&nbsp; It is not at all prudent to hunt them, for they are
said to be extremely ferocious.&nbsp; When, indeed, you find two
or three of them separated from the main herd, you may venture to
attack them; but the assailants must be numerous, in order to
make sure of their game, for if they do not kill the animal at
once there is decided danger of his killing them.&nbsp; One day
we perceived one of these creatures licking up the nitre in a
small place encircled with rocks.&nbsp; Eight men, armed with
matchlocks, left the caravan, and posted themselves in ambush,
without being detected by the bull.&nbsp; Eight gun-shots were
fired at once; the bull raised his head, looked round with fiery
eyes in search of the places whence he had been assailed, and
then dashed over the rocks into the plain, where he tore about
furiously, roaring awfully.&nbsp; The hunters affirmed that he
had been wounded, but that, intimidated by the appearance of the
caravan, he had not ventured to turn upon his assailants.</p>
<p>Wild mules are also very numerous in Hither Tartary.&nbsp;
After we had passed the Mourou&iuml;-Oussou we saw some almost
every day.&nbsp; This animal, which our naturalists call
<i>cheval h&eacute;mione</i>, a horse half-ass, is of the size of
an ordinary mule; but its form is finer and its movements more
graceful and active; its hair, red on the back, grows lighter and
lighter down to the belly, where it is almost white.&nbsp; The
head, large and ugly, is wholly at variance with the elegance of
its body; when in slow motion, it carries its head erect, and its
long ears extended; when it gallops, it turns its head to the
wind, and raises its tail, which exactly resembles that of the
ordinary mule; its neigh is ringing, clear, and sonorous, and its
speed so great that no Thibetian or Tartar horseman can overtake
it.&nbsp; The mode of taking it, is to post oneself in ambush
near the places that lead to the springs where they drink, and to
shoot it with arrows or bullets: the flesh is excellent, and the
skins are converted into boots.&nbsp; The h&eacute;miones are
productive, and their young, from generation to generation, are
always of the same species.&nbsp; They have never been tamed to
domestic purposes.&nbsp; We heard of <!-- page 121--><a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>individuals
having been taken quite young, and brought up with other foals;
but it has always been found impracticable to mount them or to
get them to carry any burden.&nbsp; With the first opportunity,
they run away, and resume their wild state.&nbsp; It did not,
however, appear to us that they were so extremely fierce as they
were represented: we have seen them frolicking about with the
horses of our caravan, when pasturing; and it was only on the
approach of man, whom they see and scent at a great distance,
that they took to flight.&nbsp; The lynx, the chamois, the
reindeer, and the wild goat abound in Hither Tartary.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Some days after the passage of the Mourou&iuml;-Oussou, the
caravan began to break up; those who had camels, went on a-head,
refusing to be any longer delayed by the slow progress of the
long-haired oxen.&nbsp; Besides, the nature of the country no
longer permitted so large a body to encamp on one spot.&nbsp; The
pasturages became so scarce and meagre, that the animals of the
caravan could not travel all together, without the danger of
starving all together.&nbsp; We joined the camel party, and soon
left behind us the long-haired oxen.&nbsp; The camel party itself
was before long fain to subdivide; and the grand unity once
broken, there were formed a number of petty caravans, which did
not always concur, either as to the place of encampment or the
hour of departure.</p>
<p><!-- page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>We were imperceptibly attaining the highest point of
Upper Asia, when a terrible north wind, which lasted fifteen
days, combined with the fearful severity of the temperature,
menaced us with destruction.&nbsp; The weather was still clear;
but the cold was so intense that even at mid-day we scarcely felt
the influence of the sun&rsquo;s rays, and then we had the utmost
difficulty in standing against the wind.&nbsp; During the rest of
the day, and more especially during the night, we were under
constant apprehension of dying with cold.&nbsp; Everybody&rsquo;s
face and hands were regularly ploughed up.&nbsp; To give
something like an idea of this cold, the reality of which,
however, can never be appreciated, except by those who have felt
it, it may suffice to mention a circumstance which seemed to us
rather striking.&nbsp; Every morning, before proceeding on our
journey, we ate a meal, and then we did not eat again until the
evening, after we had encamped.&nbsp; As tsamba is not a very
toothsome affair, we could not get down, at a time, as much as
was required for our nourishment during the day; so we used to
make three or four balls of it, with our tea, and keep these in
reserve, to be eaten, from time to time, on our road.&nbsp; The
hot paste was wrapped in a piece of hot linen, and then deposited
in our breast.&nbsp; Over it, were all our clothes; to wit, a
thick robe of sheepskin, then a lamb-skin jacket, then a short
fox-skin cloak, and then a great wool overall; now, upon every
one of the fifteen days in question, our tsamba cakes were always
frozen.&nbsp; When we took them out, they were merely so many
balls of ice, which, notwithstanding, we were fain to devour, at
the risk of breaking our teeth, in order to avoid the greater
risk of starvation.</p>
<p>The animals, overcome with fatigue and privation, had infinite
difficulty in at all resisting the intensity of the cold.&nbsp;
The mules and horses, being less vigorous than the camels and
long-haired oxen, required especial attention.&nbsp; We were
obliged to pack them in great pieces of carpet, carefully
fastened round the body, the head being enveloped in rolls of
camel&rsquo;s hair.&nbsp; Under any other circumstances this
singular costume would have excited our hilarity, but just then,
we were in no laughing mood.&nbsp; Despite all these precautions,
the animals of the caravan were decimated by death.</p>
<p>The numerous rivers that we had to pass upon the ice were
another source of inconceivable misery and fatigue.&nbsp; Camels
are so awkward and their walk is so uncouth and heavy, that in
order to facilitate their passage, we were compelled to make a
path for them across each river, either by strewing sand and
dust, or by breaking the first coat of ice with our
hatchets.&nbsp; After this, we had to take the brutes, one by
one, and guide them carefully over the path thus traced out; if
they had the <!-- page 123--><a name="page123"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>ill-luck to stumble or slip, it was
all over with them; down they threw themselves on the ice, and it
was only with the utmost labour they could be got up again.&nbsp;
We had first to take off their baggage, then to drag them with
ropes to the bank, and then to stretch a carpet on which they
might be induced to rise; sometimes all this labour was lost: you
might beat the obstinate animals, pull them, kick them; not an
effort would they make to get on their legs; in such cases, the
only course was to leave them where they lay, for it was clearly
impossible to wait, in those hideous localities, until the
pig-headed brute chose to rise.</p>
<p>All these combined miseries ended in casting the poor
travellers into a depression bordering on despair.&nbsp; To the
mortality of the animals, was now added that of the men, who,
hopelessly seized upon by the cold, were abandoned, yet living,
on the road.&nbsp; One day, when the exhaustion of our animals
had compelled us to relax our march, so that we were somewhat
behind the main body, we perceived a traveller sitting on a great
stone, his head bent forward on his chest, his arms pressed
against his sides, and his whole frame motionless as a
statue.&nbsp; We called to him several times, but he made no
reply, and did not even indicate, by the slightest movement, that
he heard us.&nbsp; &ldquo;How absurd,&rdquo; said we to each
other, &ldquo;for a man to loiter in this way in such dreadful
weather.&nbsp; The wretched fellow will assuredly die of
cold.&rdquo;&nbsp; We called to him once more, but he remained
silent and motionless as before.&nbsp; We dismounted, went up to
him, and recognised in him a young Mongol Lama, who had often
paid us a visit in our tent.&nbsp; His face was exactly like wax,
and his eyes, half-opened, had a glassy appearance; icicles hung
from his nostrils and from the corners of his mouth.&nbsp; We
spoke to him, but obtained no answer; and for a moment we thought
him dead.&nbsp; Presently, however, he opened his eyes, and fixed
them upon us with a horrible expression of stupifaction: the poor
creature was frozen, and we comprehended at once that he had been
abandoned by his companions.&nbsp; It seemed to us so frightful
to leave a man to die, without making an effort to save him, that
we did not hesitate to take him with us.&nbsp; We took him from
the stone on which he had been placed, enveloped him in a
wrapper, seated him upon Samdadchiemba&rsquo;s little mule, and
thus brought him to the encampment.&nbsp; When we had set up our
tent, we went to visit the companions of this poor young
man.&nbsp; Upon our informing them what we had done, they
prostrated themselves in token of thanks, and said that we were
people of excellent hearts, but that we had given ourselves much
labour in vain, for that the case was beyond cure.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He is frozen,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;and nothing can
prevent the <!-- page 124--><a name="page124"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 124</span>cold from getting to his
heart.&rdquo;&nbsp; We ourselves did not participate in this
despairing view of the case, and we returned to our tent,
accompanied by one of the patient&rsquo;s companions, to see what
further could be done.&nbsp; When we reached our temporary home,
the young Lama was dead.</p>
<p>More than forty men of the caravan were abandoned still
living, in the desert, without the slightest possibility of our
aiding them.&nbsp; They were carried on horseback and on
camelback so long as any hope remained, but when they could no
longer eat, or speak, or hold themselves up, they were left on
the way-side.&nbsp; The general body of the caravan could not
stay to nurse them, in a barren desert, where there was hourly
danger of wild beasts, of robbers, and, worse than all, of a
deficiency of food.&nbsp; Yet, it was a fearful spectacle to see
these dying men abandoned on the road!&nbsp; As a last token of
sympathy, we placed beside each, a wooden cup and a small bag of
barley-meal, and then the caravan mournfully proceeded on its
way.&nbsp; As soon as the last straggler had passed on, the crows
and vultures that incessantly hovered above the caravan, would
pounce down upon the unhappy creatures who retained just enough
of life to feel themselves torn and mangled by these birds of
prey.</p>
<p>The north wind greatly aggravated M. Gabet&rsquo;s
malady.&nbsp; From day to day his condition grew more
alarming.&nbsp; His extreme weakness would not permit him to
walk, and being thus precluded from warming himself by means of a
little exercise, his feet, hands, and face were completely
frozen; his lips became livid, and his eyes almost extinct;
by-and-by he was not able to support himself on horseback.&nbsp;
Our only remedy was to wrap him in blankets, to pack him upon a
camel, and to leave the rest to the merciful goodness of Divine
Providence.</p>
<p>One day, as we were following the sinuosities of a valley, our
hearts oppressed with sad thoughts, all of a sudden we perceived
two horsemen make their appearance on the ridge of an adjacent
hill.&nbsp; At this time, we were travelling in the company of a
small party of Thibetian merchants, who, like ourselves, had
allowed the main body of the caravan to precede them, in order to
save their camels the fatigue of a too hurried march.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Tsong-Kaba,&rdquo; cried the Thibetians, &ldquo;see, there
are horsemen yonder, yet we are in the desert, and every one
knows that there are not even shepherds in this
locality.&rdquo;&nbsp; They had scarcely uttered these words,
when a number of other horsemen appeared at different points on
the hills, and, to our extreme alarm, dashed down towards us at a
gallop.&nbsp; What could these horsemen be doing in so barren a
region?&nbsp; What could they want with us?&nbsp; The case was
clear: we had fallen into <!-- page 125--><a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>the hands
of thieves.&nbsp; Their appearance, as they approached, was
anything but reassuring: a carbine slung at the saddle bow, two
long sabres in the girdle, thick black hair falling in disorder
over the shoulders, glaring eyes, and a wolf&rsquo;s skin stuck
on the head by way of cap; such was the portrait of each of the
gentlemen who now favoured us with their company.&nbsp; There
were twenty-seven of them, while we numbered only eighteen, of
which eighteen all were by no means practised warriors.&nbsp;
However, both armies alighted, and a valorous Thibetian of our
party advanced to parley with the chief of the brigands, who was
distinguished from his men by two red pennants which floated from
his saddle back.&nbsp; After a long and somewhat animated
conversation; &ldquo;Who is that man?&rdquo; asked the chief of
the Kolo, pointing to M. Gabet, who, fastened upon his camel, was
the only person who had not alighted.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is a Grand
Lama of the western sky,&rdquo; replied the Thibetian merchant;
&ldquo;the power of his prayers is infinite.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
Kolo raised his clasped hands to his forehead, in token of
respect, and looked at M. Gabet, who, with his frozen face, and
his singular envelope of many-coloured wrappers, was by no means
unlike those alarming idols that we see in pagan temples.&nbsp;
After contemplating for awhile the famous Lama of the western
sky, the brigand addressed some further words, in an under tone,
to the Thibetian merchant; then, making a sign to his companions,
they all jumped into their saddles, set off at a gallop, and soon
disappeared behind the mountains.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do not let us go
any further to-day,&rdquo; said the Thibetian merchant;
&ldquo;but set up our tents where we are; the Kolo are robbers,
but they have lofty and generous souls; when they see that we
place ourselves without fear in their hands, they will not attack
us.&nbsp; Besides,&rdquo; added he, &ldquo;I believe they hold in
much awe the power of the Lamas of the western sky.&rdquo;&nbsp;
We adopted the counsel of the Thibetian merchants, and proceeded
to encamp.</p>
<p>The tents were scarcely set up, when the Kolo reappeared on
the crest of the mountain, and once more galloped down upon us
with their habitual impetuosity. The chief alone entered the
encampment, his men awaiting him at a short distance
outside.&nbsp; The Kolo addressed the Thibetian who had
previously conversed with him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have come,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;for an explanation of a point that I don&rsquo;t
at all understand.&nbsp; You know that we are encamped on the
other side of the mountain, yet you venture to set up your tents
here, close by us.&nbsp; How many men, then, have you in your
company?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We are only eighteen; you, I
believe, are twenty-seven in number; but brave men never run
away.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll fight, then?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;If there were not several invalids amongst us, I would
answer, Yes; for I have already shown the Kolo that I am <!--
page 126--><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>not afraid of them.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you fought
with the Kolo?&nbsp; When was it?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s your
name?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s five years ago, at the
affair of the Tchanak-Kampo, and here&rsquo;s a little
reminiscence of it;&rdquo; and, throwing back the sleeve of his
right arm, he showed the cicatrice of a great sabre cut.&nbsp;
The brigand laughed, and again requested his interlocutor&rsquo;s
name.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am called Rala-Tchembe,&rdquo; said the
merchant; &ldquo;you ought to know the name.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, all the Kolos know it; it is the name of a brave
man.&rdquo;&nbsp; So saying, he dismounted, and taking a sabre
from his girdle, presented it to the Thibetian.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;accept this sabre; &rsquo;tis
the best I have; we have fought one another before; in future,
when we meet, it shall be as brothers.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Thibetian
received the brigand&rsquo;s present, and gave him, in return, a
handsome bow and quiver which he had bought at Peking.</p>
<p>The Kolo, who had remained outside the camp, upon seeing their
chief fraternize with the chief of the caravan, dismounted,
fastened their horses to each other, two and two, by the bridles,
and came to drink a friendly cup of tea with the travellers, who
now, at length, began to breathe freely.&nbsp; All these brigands
were extremely affable, and they asked us various questions about
the Tartar-Khalkhas, whom, they said, they were particularly
anxious to see, by reason that, in the preceding year, these
warriors had killed three of their companions, whom they were
eager to avenge.&nbsp; We had a little chat about politics
too.&nbsp; The brigands affirmed that they were warm friends of
the Tal&eacute;-Lama, and irreconcilable enemies to the Emperor
of China; on which account they seldom failed to pillage the
embassy on its way to Peking, because the Emperor was unworthy to
receive gifts from the Tal&eacute;-Lama, but that they ordinarily
respected it on its return, because it was altogether fitting
that the Emperor should send gifts to the Tal&eacute;-Lama.&nbsp;
After having done honour to the tea and tsamba of the caravan,
the brigands wished us a good journey, and returned to their own
encampment.&nbsp; All these fraternal manifestations did not
prevent our sleeping with one eye open; our repose, however, was
not disturbed, and in the morning we resumed our way in
peace.&nbsp; Of the many thousands of pilgrims who have performed
the journey to Lha-Ssa, there are very few who can boast of
having had so close a view of the robbers, at so small a
cost.</p>
<p>We had escaped one great danger; but another awaited us, we
were informed, far more formidable in its character, though
different in kind.&nbsp; We were beginning to ascend the vast
chain of the Tant-La mountains; on the plateau of which, our
travelling companions assured us, the invalids would die, and
those who were now well would become invalids, with but a small
chance of living.&nbsp; <!-- page 127--><a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>The death
of M. Gabet was considered quite a matter of certainty.&nbsp;
After six days laborious ascent of several mountains, placed
amphitheatrically, one above another, we at length reached the
famous plateau, the most elevated point, perhaps, on the
earth&rsquo;s surface.&nbsp; The snow there appeared an
incrustation, an ordinary portion of the soil.&nbsp; It cracked
beneath our feet, but the feet left scarcely any impression upon
it.&nbsp; The entire vegetation consisted of an occasional tuft
of a low, sharp-pointed, smooth grass, ligneous within, and as
hard as iron, but not brittle; so that it might very well be
converted into mattress needles.&nbsp; The animals were, however,
so famishing, that they were fain to attack even this atrocious
forage, which absolutely cracked between their teeth, and could
be realized at all only by vigorous efforts and at the cost of
infinite lip bleeding.</p>
<p>From the brow of this magnificent plateau, we could see below
us the peaks and needles of numerous ridges, the ramifications of
which were lost in the horizon.&nbsp; We had never witnessed
anything at all comparable with this grand, this gigantic
spectacle.&nbsp; During the twelve days that we were journeying
along the heights of Tant-La, we enjoyed fine weather; the air
was calm, and it pleased God to bless us each day with a warm,
genial sunshine, that materially modified the ordinary coldness
of the atmosphere.&nbsp; Still the air, excessively rarified at
that enormous altitude, was very piercing, and monstrous eagles,
which followed the track of the caravan, were daily provided with
a number of dead bodies.&nbsp; The small caravan of the French
mission itself paid its tribute to death; but, happily, that
tribute was only in the shape of our little black mule, which we
abandoned at once with regret and with resignation.&nbsp; The
dismal prophecy that had been announced with reference to M.
Gabet was falsified.&nbsp; The mountains, which were to have been
fatal to him, proved, on the contrary, highly favourable,
restoring to him, by degrees, health and strength.&nbsp; This
blessing, almost unexpected by us, even at the hands of the God
of Mercy, made us forget all our past miseries.&nbsp; We resumed
all our courage, and firmly entertained the hope that the
Almighty would permit us to accomplish our journey.</p>
<p>The descent of Tant-La, though long in duration, was rapid in
itself.&nbsp; Throughout four whole days, we were going down, as
it seemed, a gigantic staircase, each step of which consisted of
a mountain.&nbsp; At the bottom, we found some hot springs, of an
extremely magnificent description.&nbsp; Amongst huge rocks, you
see a great number of reservoirs, hollowed out by the hand of
nature, in which the water boils and bubbles, as in a vast
cauldron over a fierce fire.&nbsp; Sometimes the active fluid
escapes through the fissures <!-- page 128--><a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>of the
rocks, and leaps, in all directions, by a thousand capricious
jets.&nbsp; Every now and then the ebullition, in particular
reservoirs, grows so furious, that tall columns of water rise
into the air, as though impelled by some tremendous pumping
machinery.&nbsp; Above these springs, thick vapours, collecting
in the air, condense into white clouds.&nbsp; The water is
sulphureous.&nbsp; After bubbling and dashing about in its huge
granite reservoirs, it boils over, and quitting the rocks, which
had seemed to wish to keep it captive, pours down by various
currents into a small valley below, where it forms a large stream
flowing over a bed of flints, yellow as gold.&nbsp; These boiling
waters do not long preserve their fluidity.&nbsp; The extreme
rigour of the atmosphere cools them so rapidly, that within a
mile and a half from its source, the stream they have thus formed
is almost frozen through.&nbsp; These hot springs are of frequent
occurrence in the mountains of Thibet, and the Lama physicians,
who attribute to them considerable medicinal virtue, constantly
prescribe their use, both internally and externally.</p>
<p>From the Tant-La mountains to Lha-Ssa, the ground constantly
declines.&nbsp; As you descend, the intensity of the cold
diminishes, and the earth becomes clothed with more vigorous and
more varied vegetation.&nbsp; One evening, we encamped in a large
plain, where the pasturage was marvellously abundant, and as our
cattle had been for some time past on very short commons indeed,
we determined to give them the full benefit of the present
opportunity, and to remain where we were for two days.</p>
<p>Next morning, as we were quietly preparing our tea, we
perceived in the distance a troop of horsemen galloping towards
our encampment at full speed.&nbsp; The sight seemed to freeze
the very blood in our veins; we stood for a moment perfectly
petrified.&nbsp; After the first moment of stupor, we rushed out
of our tent, and ran to Rala-Tchemb&eacute;.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
Kolo! the Kolo!&rdquo; cried we; &ldquo;here&rsquo;s a great body
of Kolo advancing against us.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Thibetian
merchants, who were boiling their tea and mixing their tsamba,
laughed at our alarm, and told us to sit down quite at our
ease.&nbsp; &ldquo;Take breakfast with us,&rdquo; said they;
&ldquo;there are no Kolo to fear here; the horsemen you see
yonder are friends.&nbsp; We are now entering upon an inhabited
country; behind the hill there, to the right, are a number of
black tents, and the horsemen, whom you take to be Kolo, are
shepherds.&rdquo;&nbsp; These words restored our equanimity, and
with our equanimity returned our appetite, so that we were very
happy to accept the invitation to breakfast with which we had
been favoured.&nbsp; We had scarcely taken up a cup of buttered
tea before the horsemen made their appearance at the door of the
tent.&nbsp; So far from being brigands, they were worthy fellows
who came to sell us butter <!-- page 129--><a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>and fresh
meat; their saddles were regular butchers&rsquo; stalls hung with
joints of mutton and venison, which rested on the sides of their
horses.&nbsp; We purchased eight legs of mutton, which, being
frozen, were easily susceptible of transport.&nbsp; They cost us
an old pair of Peking boots, a Peking steel, and the saddle of
our defunct mule, which luckily could also boast of Peking
origin.&nbsp; Everything coming from Peking is highly prized by
the Thibetians, more especially by that portion of the population
which has not advanced beyond the pastoral and nomadic
life.&nbsp; The merchants who accompany the caravan take care,
accordingly, to label every package &ldquo;Goods from
Peking.&rdquo;&nbsp; Snuff is especially an object of earnest
competition among the Thibetians.&nbsp; All the shepherds asked
us whether we had not snuff from Peking.&nbsp; M. Huc, who was
the only snuff-taker of our party, had formerly possessed a
quantity of the precious commodity, but it had all departed, and
for the last eight days he had been reduced to the necessity of
filling his snuff-box and his nose with a frightful mixture of
dust and ashes.&nbsp; Those who are devotees of snuff, will at
once comprehend all the horrors to poor M. Huc of this deplorable
position.</p>
<p>Condemned for the last two months to live upon barley-meal,
moistened with tea, the mere sight of our legs of mutton seemed
to fortify our stomachs and invigorate our emaciated limbs.&nbsp;
The remainder of the day was occupied in culinary
preparations.&nbsp; By way of condiment and seasoning, we had
only a little garlic, and that little so frozen and dried that it
was almost imperceptible in its shell.&nbsp; We peeled, however,
all we had, and stuck it into two legs of mutton, which we set to
boil in our great cauldron.&nbsp; The argols, which abounded in
this blessed plain, supplied ample materials for cooking our
inestimable supper.&nbsp; The sun was just setting, and
Samdadchiemba, who had been inspecting one of the legs of mutton
with his thumb-nail, had triumphantly announced that the mutton
was boiled to a bubble, when we heard in all directions, the
disastrous cry, &ldquo;Fire! fire!&rdquo; (<i>Mi yon! mi
yon</i>!)&nbsp; At one bound we were outside our tent, where we
found that the flame, which had caught some dry grass, in the
interior of the encampment, and menaced to assail also our linen
tents, was spreading about, in all directions, with fearful
rapidity.&nbsp; All the travellers, armed with their felt
carpets, were endeavouring to stifle the flame, or at all events
to keep it from reaching the tents, and in this latter effort
they were quite successful.&nbsp; The fire, repulsed on all
sides, forced an issue from the encampment, and rushed out into
the desert, where, driven by the wind, it spread over the
pasturages, which it devoured as it went.&nbsp; We thought,
however, that we had nothing further to fear; but the cry,
&ldquo;Save the camels! save the <!-- page 130--><a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>
<a href="images/p130.jpg">
<img class='clearcenter' alt=

title=

src="images/p130.jpg" />
</a> camels!&rdquo; at once reminded us how little we knew of a
conflagration in the desert.</p>
<p>We soon perceived that the camels stolidly awaited the flame,
instead of fleeing from it, as the horses and oxen did.&nbsp; We
hereupon hastened to the succour of our beasts, which, at the
moment, seemed tolerably remote from the flame.&nbsp; The flame,
however, reached them as soon as we did, and at once surrounded
us and them.&nbsp; It was to no purpose we pushed and beat the
stupid brutes; not an inch would they stir; but there they stood
phlegmatically gaping at us with an air that seemed to ask us,
what right we had to come and interrupt them at their
meals.&nbsp; We really felt as if we could have killed the
impracticable beasts.&nbsp; The fire consumed so rapidly the
grass it encountered, that it soon assailed the camels, and
caught their long, thick hair; and it was with the utmost
exertion that, by the aid of the felt carpets we had brought with
us, we extinguished the flame upon their bodies.&nbsp; We got
three of them out of the fire, with only the end of their hair
singed, but the fourth was reduced to a deplorable condition;
<!-- page 131--><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>not a bristle remained on its entire body; the whole
system of hair was burned down to the skim, and the skin itself
was terribly charred.</p>
<p>The extent of pasturage consumed by the flame might be about a
mile and a quarter long by three quarters of a mile broad.&nbsp;
The Thibetians were in ecstasies at their good fortune in having
the progress of conflagration so soon stayed, and we fully
participated in their joy, when we learned the full extent of the
evil with which we had been menaced.&nbsp; We were informed that
if the fire had continued much longer it would have reached the
black tents, in which case the shepherds would have pursued and
infallibly massacred us.&nbsp; Nothing can equal the fury of
these poor children of the desert when they find the pastures,
which are their only resource, reduced to ashes, no matter
whether by malice or by mischance.&nbsp; It is much the same
thing to them as destroying their herds.</p>
<p>When we resumed our journey the broiled camel was not yet
dead, but it was altogether incapable of service; the three
others were fain to yield to circumstances, and to share among
them the portion of baggage which their unlucky travelling
companion had hitherto borne.&nbsp; However, the burdens of all
of them had very materially diminished in weight since our
departure from Koukou-Noor; our sacks of meal had become little
better than sacks of emptiness; so that, after descending the
Tant-La mountains we had been compelled to put ourselves upon an
allowance of two cups of tsamba per man, per diem.&nbsp; Before
our departure we had made a fair calculation of our reasonable
wants, <i>in prospectu</i>; but no such calculation could cover
the waste committed upon our provender by our two cameleers; by
the one through indifference and stupidity, by the other through
malice and knavery.</p>
<p>Fortunately we were now approaching a large Thibetian station,
where we should find the means of renewing our stores.</p>
<p>After following, for several days, a long series of valleys,
where we saw, from time to time, black tents and great herds of
yaks, we at last encamped beside a large Thibetian village.&nbsp;
It stands on the banks of the river Na-Ptchu, indicated on M.
Andriveau-Goujon&rsquo;s map, by the Mongol name of Khara-Oussou,
both denominations equally signifying black waters.&nbsp; The
village of Na-Ptchu is the first Thibetian station of any
importance that you pass on this route to Lha-Ssa.&nbsp; The
village consists of mud-houses and a number of black tents.&nbsp;
The inhabitants do not cultivate the ground.&nbsp; Although they
always live on the same spot, they are shepherds like the nomadic
tribes, and occupy themselves solely with the breeding of
cattle.&nbsp; We were informed that at some very remote period, a
king of Koukou-Noor made war upon the <!-- page 132--><a
name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>Thibetians,
and having subjugated them to a large extent, gave the district
of Na-Ptchu to the soldiers whom he had brought with him.&nbsp;
Though these Tartars are now fused with the Thibetians, one may
still observe among the black tents, a certain number of Mongol
huts.&nbsp; This event may also serve to explain the origin of a
number of Mongol expressions which are used in the country,
having passed within the domain of the Thibetian idiom.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p132.jpg">
<img alt=
"View of Na-Ptchu"
title=
"View of Na-Ptchu"
src="images/p132.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The caravans which repair to Lha-Ssa, are necessitated to
remain several days at Na-Ptchu, in order to arrange a fresh
system of conveyance; for the difficulties of an awfully rocky
road do not permit camels to proceed further.&nbsp; Our first
business, therefore, was to sell our animals; but they were so
wretchedly worn that no one would look at them.&nbsp; At last, a
sort of veterinary surgeon, who, doubtless, had some recipe for
restoring their strength and appearances, made us an offer, and
we sold him the three for fifteen ounces of silver, throwing in
the grilled one into the bargain.&nbsp; These fifteen ounces of
silver just sufficed to pay the hire of six long-haired oxen, to
carry our baggage to Lha-Ssa.</p>
<p>A second operation was to discharge the Lama of the Ratchico
mountains.&nbsp; After having settled with him on very liberal
terms, we told him that if he proposed to visit Lha-Ssa, he must
find some other companions, for that he might consider himself
<!-- page 133--><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>wholly freed from the engagements which he had
contracted with us; and so, at last, we got rid of this rascal,
whose misconduct had fully doubled the trouble and misery that we
had experienced on the way in his company.</p>
<p>Our conscience imposes upon us the duty of here warning
persons whom any circumstances may lead to Na-Ptchu, to be
carefully on their guard there against thieves.&nbsp; The
inhabitants of this Thibetian village are remarkable for their
peculations, robbing every Mongol or other caravan that comes to
the place, in the most shameful manner.&nbsp; At night, they
creep into the travellers&rsquo; tents, and carry off whatever
they can lay hands upon; and in broad day itself they exercise
their deplorable ingenuity in this line, with a coolness, a
presence of mind, and an ability which might arouse envy in the
most distinguished Parisian thieves.</p>
<p>After having laid in a supply of butter, tsamba, and legs of
mutton, we proceeded on our way to Lha-Ssa, from which we were
now only distant fifteen days&rsquo; march.&nbsp; Our travelling
companions were some Mongols of the kingdom of Khartchin, who
were repairing in pilgrimage to Mouhe-Dehot (the Eternal
Sanctuary) as the Tartars call Lha-Ssa, and who had with them
their Grand Chaberon; that is to say, a Living Buddha, the
superior of their Lamasery.&nbsp; This Chaberon was a young man
of eighteen, whose manners were agreeable and gentlemanly, and
whose face, full of ingenuous candour, contrasted singularly with
the part which he was constrained habitually to enact.&nbsp; At
the age of five he had been declared Buddha and Grand Lama of the
Buddhists of Khartchin, and he was now about to pass a few years
in one of the Grand Lamaseries of Lha-Ssa, in the study of
prayers and of the other knowledge befitting his dignity.&nbsp; A
brother of the King of Khartchin and several Lamas of quality
were in attendance to escort and wait upon him.&nbsp; The title
of Living Buddha seemed to be a dead weight upon this poor young
man.&nbsp; It was quite manifest that he would very much have
liked to laugh and chat and frolic about at his ease; and that,
<i>en route</i>, it would have been far more agreeable to him to
have dashed about on his horse, whither he fancied, than to ride,
as he did, solemnly between two horsemen, who, out of their
extreme respect, never once quitted his sides.&nbsp; Again, when
they had reached an encampment, instead of remaining eternally
squatted on cushions, in a corner of his tent, apeing the idols
in the Lamasery, he would have liked to have rambled about the
desert, taking part in the occupations of nomadic life; but he
was permitted to do nothing of the sort.&nbsp; His business was
to be Buddha, and to concern himself in no degree with matters
which appertained to mere mortals.</p>
<p><!-- page 134--><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>The young Chaberon derived no small pleasure from an
occasional chat in our tent; there, at all events, he was able to
lay aside, for a time, his official divinity, and to belong to
mankind.&nbsp; He heard with great interest what we told him
about the men and things of Europe; and questioned us, with much
ingenuity, respecting our religion, which evidently appeared to
him a very fine one.&nbsp; When we asked him, whether it would
not be better to be a worshipper of Jehovah than a Chaberon, he
replied that he could not say.&nbsp; He did not at all like us to
interrogate him respecting his anterior life, and his continual
incarnations; he would blush when any such questions were put to
him, and would always put an end to the conversation by saying
that the subject was painful to him.&nbsp; The simple fact was
that the poor lad found himself involved in a sort of religious
labyrinth, the meanderings of which were perfectly unknown to
him.</p>
<p>The road which leads from Na-Ptchu to Lha-Ssa is, in general,
rocky and very laborious, and when it attains the chain of the
Ko&iuml;ran mountains it becomes fatiguing in the highest
degree.&nbsp; Yet, as you advance, your heart grows lighter and
lighter, at finding yourself in a more and more populous
country.&nbsp; The black tents that speckle the background of the
landscape, the numerous parties of pilgrims repairing to Lha-Ssa,
the infinite inscriptions engraved on the stones erected on each
side of the way, the small caravans of long-tailed oxen that you
meet at intervals&mdash;all this contributes to alleviate the
fatigues of the journey.</p>
<p>When you come within a few days&rsquo; march of Lha-Ssa, the
exclusively nomadic character of the Thibetians gradually
disappears.&nbsp; Already, a few cultivated fields adorn the
desert; houses insensibly take the place of black tents.&nbsp; At
length, the shepherds vanish altogether, and you find yourself
amidst an agricultural people.</p>
<p>On the fifteenth day after our departure from Na-Ptchu, we
arrived at Pampou, which, on account of its proximity to Lha-Ssa
is regarded by the pilgrims as the vestibule of the holy
city.&nbsp; Pampou, erroneously designated Panctou on the map, is
a fine plain watered by a broad river, a portion of whose stream,
distributed in canals, diffuses fertility all around.&nbsp; There
is no village, properly so called; but you see, in all
directions, large farm houses with handsome terraces in front,
and beautifully white with lime-wash.&nbsp; Each is surrounded
with tall trees, and surmounted with a little tower, in the form
of a pigeon-house, whence float banners of various colours,
covered with Thibetian inscriptions.&nbsp; After travelling for
more than three months through hideous deserts, where the only
living creatures you meet are brigands and wild beasts, the plain
of Pampou seemed to us the most delicious spot in the <!-- page
135--><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>world.&nbsp; Our long and painful journeying had so
nearly reduced us to the savage state, that any thing in the
shape of civilization struck us as absolutely marvellous.&nbsp;
We were in ecstasies with everything: a house, a tree, a plough,
a furrow in the ploughed field, the slightest object seemed to us
worthy of attention.&nbsp; That, however, which most forcibly
impressed us, was the prodigious elevation of the temperature
which we remarked in this cultivated plain.&nbsp; Although it was
now the end of January, the river and its canals were merely
edged with a thin coat of ice, and scarcely any of the people
wore furs.</p>
<p>At Pampou, our caravan had to undergo another
transformation.&nbsp; Generally speaking, the long-haired oxen
are here replaced by donkeys, small in size, but very robust, and
accustomed to carry baggage.&nbsp; The difficulty of procuring a
sufficient number of these donkeys to convey the baggage of the
Khartchin-Lamas, rendered it necessary for us to remain two days
at Pampou.&nbsp; We availed ourselves of the opportunity to
arrange our toilet, as well as we could.&nbsp; Our hair and
beards were so thick, our faces so blackened with the smoke of
the tent, so ploughed up with the cold, so worn, so deplorable,
that, when we had here the means of looking at ourselves in a
glass, we were ready to weep with compassion at our melancholy
appearance.&nbsp; Our costume was perfectly in unison with our
persons.</p>
<p>The people of Pampou are for the most part in very easy
circumstances, and they are always gay and frolicsome
accordingly.&nbsp; Every evening they assemble, in front of the
different farms, where men, women, and children dance to the
accompaniment of their own voices.&nbsp; On the termination of
the <i>bal champ&eacute;tre</i>, the farmer regales the company
with a sort of sharp drink, made with fermented barley, and
which, with the addition of hops, would be very like our
beer.</p>
<p>After a two days&rsquo; hunt through all the farms of the
neighbourhood, the donkey-caravan was organized, and we went on
our way.&nbsp; Between us and Lha-Ssa there was only a mountain,
but this mountain was, past contradiction, the most rugged and
toilsome that we had as yet encountered.&nbsp; The Thibetians and
Mongols ascend it with great unction, for it is understood
amongst them that whoever attains its summit, attains, <i>ipso
facto</i>, a remission of all his or her sins.&nbsp; This is
certain, at all events, that whoever attains the summit has
undergone on his way a most severe penance: whether that penance
is adequate to the remission of sins, is another question
altogether.&nbsp; We had departed at one o&rsquo;clock in the
morning, yet it was not till ten in the forenoon that we reached
this so beneficial summit.&nbsp; We were fain to walk nearly the
whole <!-- page 136--><a name="page136"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 136</span>distance, so impracticable is it to
retain one&rsquo;s seat on horseback along the rugged and rocky
path.</p>
<p>The sun was nearly setting when, issuing from the last of the
infinite sinuosities of the mountain, we found ourselves in a
vast plain, and saw on our right Lha-Ssa, the famous metropolis
of the Buddhic world.&nbsp; The multitude of aged trees which
surround the city with a verdant wall; the tall white houses,
with their flat roofs and their towers; the numerous temples with
their gilt roofs, the Buddha-La, above which rises the palace of
the Tal&eacute;-Lama&mdash;all these features communicate to
Lha-Ssa a majestic and imposing aspect.</p>
<p>At the entrance of the town, some Mongols with whom we had
formed an acquaintance on the road, and who had preceded us by
several days, met us, and invited us to accompany them to
lodgings which they had been friendly enough to prepare for
us.&nbsp; It was now the 29th January, 1846; and it was eighteen
months since we had parted from the Valley of Black Waters.</p>

<p>After eighteen months struggle with sufferings and obstacles
of infinite number and variety, we were at length arrived at the
termination of our journey, though not at the close of our
miseries.&nbsp; We had no longer, it is true, to fear death from
famine or frost in this inhabited country; but trials and
tribulations of a different <!-- page 138--><a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>character
were, no doubt, about to assail us, amidst the infidel
populations, to whom we desired to preach Christ crucified for
the salvation of mankind.&nbsp; Physical troubles over, we had
now to undergo moral sufferings; but we relied, as before, on the
infinite goodness of the Lord to aid us in the fight, trusting
that He who had protected us in the desert against the inclemency
of the seasons, would continue to us His divine assistance
against the malice of man, in the very heart and capital of
Buddhism.</p>
<p>The morning after our arrival at Lha-Ssa, we engaged a
Thibetian guide, and visited the various quarters of the city, in
search of a lodging.&nbsp; The houses at Lha-Ssa are for the most
part several stories high, terminating in a terrace slightly
sloped, in order to carry off the water; they are whitewashed all
over, except the bordering round the doors and windows, which are
painted red or yellow.&nbsp; The reformed Buddhists are so fond
of these two colours, which are, so to speak, sacred in their
eyes, that they especially name them Lamanesque colours.&nbsp;
The people of Lha-Ssa are in the habit of painting their houses
once a year, so that they are always perfectly clean, and seem,
in fact, just built; but the interior is by no means in harmony
with the fine outside.&nbsp; The rooms are dirty, smoky,
stinking, and encumbered with all sorts of utensils and
furniture, thrown about in most disgusting confusion.&nbsp; In a
word, the Thibetian habitations are literally whited sepulchres;
a perfect picture of Buddhism and all other false religions,
which carefully cover, with certain general truths and certain
moral principles, the corruption and falsehood within.</p>
<p>After a long search, we selected two rooms, in a large house,
that contained in all fifty lodgers.&nbsp; Our humble abode was
at the top of the house, and to reach it we had to ascend
twenty-six wooden stairs, without railing, and so steep and
narrow that in order to prevent the disagreeable incident of
breaking our necks, we always found it prudent to use our hands
as well as our feet.&nbsp; Our suite of apartments consisted of
one great square room and one small closet, which we honoured
with the appellation of cabinet.&nbsp; The larger room was
lighted, north-east, by a narrow window, provided with three
thick wooden bars, and above, by a small round skylight, which
latter aperture served for a variety of purposes; first it gave
entrance to the light, the wind, the rain, and the snow: and
secondly, it gave issue to the smoke from our fire.&nbsp; To
protect themselves from the winter&rsquo;s cold, the Thibetians
place in the centre of their rooms a small vessel of glazed
earth, in which they burn argols.&nbsp; As this combustible is
extremely addicted to diffuse considerably more smoke than heat,
those who desire to warm themselves, find it of infinite
advantage to have a <!-- page 139--><a name="page139"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 139</span>hole in the ceiling, which enables
them to light a fire without incurring the risk of being stifled
by the smoke.&nbsp; You do, indeed, undergo the small
inconvenience of receiving, from time to time, a fall of snow, or
rain, on your back; but those who have followed the nomadic life
are not deterred by such trifles.&nbsp; The furniture of our
larger apartment consisted of two goat-skins spread on the floor,
right and left of the fire dish; of two saddles, our travelling
tent, some old pairs of boots, two dilapidated trunks, three
ragged robes, hanging from nails in the wall, our night things
rolled together in a bundle, and a supply of argols in the
corner.&nbsp; We were thus placed at once on the full level of
Thibetian civilization.&nbsp; The closet, in which stood a large
brick stove, served us for kitchen and pantry, and there we
installed Samdadchiemba, who, having resigned his office of
cameleer, now concentrated the functions of cook, steward, and
groom.&nbsp; Our two white steeds were accommodated in a corner
of the court, where they reposed after their laborious but
glorious campaign, until an opportunity should present itself of
securing new masters; at present the poor beasts were so
thoroughly worn down, that we could not think of offering them
for sale, until they had developed some little flesh between the
bone and the skin.</p>
<p>As soon as we were settled in our new abode, we occupied
ourselves with inspecting the capital of Thibet, and its
population.&nbsp; Lha-Ssa is not a large town, its circuit being
at the utmost two leagues.&nbsp; It is not surrounded like the
Chinese towns with ramparts; formerly, indeed, we were told it
had walls, but these were entirely destroyed in a war which the
Thibetians had to sustain against the Indians of Boutan.&nbsp; At
present not a trace of wall remains.&nbsp; Around the suburbs,
however, are a great number of gardens, the large trees in which
form, for the town, a magnificent wall of verdure.&nbsp; The
principal streets of Lha-Ssa are broad, well laid out, and
tolerably clean, at least when it does not rain: but the suburbs
are revoltingly filthy.&nbsp; The houses, as we have already
stated, are in general large, lofty, and handsome; they are built
some with stone, some with brick, and some with mud, but they are
all so elaborately covered with lime-wash that you can
distinguish externally no difference in the material.&nbsp; In
one of the suburban districts there is a locality where the
houses are built with the horns of oxen and sheep.&nbsp; These
singular constructions are of extreme solidity and look very
well.&nbsp; The horns of the oxen being smooth and white, and
those of the sheep, on the contrary, rough and black, these
various materials are susceptible of infinite combinations, and
are arranged accordingly, in all sorts of fantastic designs; the
interstices are filled up with mortar.&nbsp; These houses are the
only <!-- page 140--><a name="page140"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 140</span>buildings that are not lime-washed;
the Thibetians having taste enough to leave the materials in
their natural aspect, without seeking to improve upon their wild
and fantastic beauty.&nbsp; It is superfluous to add, that the
inhabitants of Lha-Ssa consume an immense quantity of beef and
mutton; their horn-houses incontestably demonstrate the fact.</p>
<p>The Buddhist temples are the most remarkable edifices in
Lha-Ssa.&nbsp; We need not here describe them, for they all
closely resemble those which we have already had occasion to
portray.&nbsp; We will only remark, therefore, that the temples
of Lha-Ssa are larger, richer, and more profusely gilt than those
of other towns.</p>
<p>The palace of the Tal&eacute;-Lama merits, in every respect,
the celebrity which it enjoys throughout the world.&nbsp; North
of the town, at the distance of about a mile, there rises a
rugged mountain, of slight elevation and of conical form, which,
amid the plain, resembles an islet on the bosom of a lake.&nbsp;
This mountain is entitled Buddha-La (mountain of Buddha, divine
mountain), and upon this grand pedestal, the work of nature, the
adorers of the Tal&eacute;-Lama have raised the magnificent
palace wherein their Living Divinity resides in the flesh.&nbsp;
This palace is an aggregation of several temples, of various size
and decoration; that which occupies the centre is four stories
high, and overlooks all the rest; it terminates in a dome,
entirely covered with plates of gold, and surrounded with a
peristyle, the columns of which are, in like manner, all covered
with gold.&nbsp; It is here that the Tal&eacute;-Lama has set up
his abode.&nbsp; From the summit of this lofty sanctuary he can
contemplate, at the great solemnities, his innumerable adorers
advancing along the plain or prostrate at the foot of the divine
mountain.&nbsp; The secondary palaces, grouped round the great
temple, serve as residences for numerous Lamas, of every order,
whose continual occupation it is to serve and do honour to the
Living Buddha.&nbsp; Two fine avenues of magnificent trees lead
from Lha-Ssa to the Buddha-La, and there you always find crowds
of foreign pilgrims, telling the beads of their long Buddhist
chaplets, and Lamas of the court, attired in rich costume, and
mounted on horses splendidly caparisoned.&nbsp; Around the
Buddha-La there is constant motion; but there is, at the same
time, almost uninterrupted silence, religious meditations
appearing to occupy all men&rsquo;s minds.</p>
<p>In the town itself the aspect of the population is quite
different; there all is excitement, and noise, and pushing, and
competition, every single soul in the place being ardently
occupied in the grand business of buying and selling.&nbsp;
Commerce and devotion incessantly attracting to Lha-Ssa an
infinite number of strangers, render the place a rendezvous of
all the Asiatic peoples; so that the streets, <!-- page 141--><a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>always
crowded with pilgrims and traders, present a marvellous variety
of physiognomies, costumes, and languages.&nbsp; This immense
multitude is for the most part transitory; the fixed population
of Lha-Ssa consists of Thibetians, Pebouns, Katchis, and
Chinese.</p>
<p>The Thibetians belong to the great family which we are
accustomed to designate by the term Mongol race; they have black
eyes, a thin beard, small, contracted eyes, high cheek-bones, pug
noses, wide mouths, and thin lips; the ordinary complexion is
tawny, though, in the upper class, you find skins as white as
those of Europeans.&nbsp; The Thibetians are of the middle
height; and combine, with the agility and suppleness of the
Chinese, the force and vigour of the Tartars.&nbsp; Gymnastic
exercises of all sorts and dancing are very popular with them,
and their movements are cadenced and easy.&nbsp; As they walk
about, they are always humming some psalm or popular song;
generosity and frankness enter largely into their character;
brave in war, they face death fearlessly; they are as religious
as the Tartars, but not so credulous.&nbsp; Cleanliness is of
small estimation among them; but this does not prevent them from
being very fond of display and rich sumptuous clothing.</p>
<p>The Thibetians do not shave the head, but let the hair flow
over their shoulders, contenting themselves with clipping it,
every now and then, with the scissors.&nbsp; The dandies of
Lha-Ssa, indeed, have of late years adopted the custom of
braiding their hair in the Chinese fashion, decorating the
tresses with jewellery, precious stones, and coral.&nbsp; The
ordinary head-dress is a blue cap, with a broad border of black
velvet surmounted with a red tuft; on high days and holidays,
they wear a great red hat, in form not unlike the Basquebarret
cap, only larger and decorated at the rim with long, thick
fringe.&nbsp; A full robe fastened on the right side with four
hooks, and girded round the waist by a red sash, red or purple
cloth boots, complete the simple, yet graceful costume of the
Thibetian men.&nbsp; Suspended from the sash is a green taffeta
bag, containing their inseparable wooden cups, and two small
purses, of an oval form and richly embroidered, which contain
nothing at all, being designed merely for ornament.</p>
<p>The dress of the Thibetian women closely resembles that of the
men; the main difference is, that over the robe, they add a short
many-coloured tunic, and that they divide their hair into two
braids, one hanging down each shoulder.&nbsp; The women of the
humbler classes wear a small yellow cap, like the cap of liberty
that was in fashion in France at the time of our first
republic.&nbsp; The head decoration of the ladies is a graceful
crown composed of pearls.&nbsp; The Thibetian women submit, in
their toilet, to a custom, or rather rule, doubtless quite
unique, and altogether incredible to <!-- page 142--><a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>those who
have not actually witnessed its operation: before going out of
doors, they always rub their faces over with a sort of black,
glutinous varnish, not unlike currant jelly; and the object being
to render themselves as ugly and hideous as possible, they daub
this disgusting composition over every feature, in such a manner
as no longer to resemble human creatures.&nbsp; The origin of
this monstrous practice was thus related to us: Nearly 200 years
ago, the Nomekhan, a Lama king, who ruled over Hither Thibet, was
a man of rigid and austere manners.&nbsp; At that period, the
Thibetian women had no greater fancy for making themselves ugly
than other women; on the contrary, they were perfectly mad after
all sorts of luxury and finery, whence arose fearful disorders,
and immorality that knew no bounds.&nbsp; The contagion, by
degrees, seized upon the holy family of the Lamas; the Buddhist
monasteries relaxed their ancient and severe discipline, and were
a prey to evils which menaced them with complete and rapid
dissolution.&nbsp; In order to stay the progress of a libertinism
which had become almost general, the Nomekhan published an edict,
prohibiting women from appearing in public otherwise than with
their faces bedaubed, in the manner we have described.&nbsp;
Lofty, moral, and religious considerations were adduced in
support of this strange law, and the refractory were menaced with
the severest penalties, and above all, with the wrath of
Buddha.&nbsp; There needed, assuredly, more than ordinary courage
to publish such an edict as this; but the most extraordinary
circumstance of all is, that the women were perfectly resigned
and obedient.&nbsp; Tradition has handed down not the least hint
of any insurrection, or the slightest disturbance even, on the
subject, and conformably with the law, the women have blackened
themselves furiously and uglified themselves fearfully, down to
the present time.&nbsp; In fact, the thing has now come to be
considered a point of dogma, an article of devotion; the women
who daub themselves most disgustingly being reputed the most
pious.&nbsp; In the country places the edict is observed with
scrupulous exactitude, and to the entire approbation of the
censors; but at Lha-Ssa, it is not unusual to meet in the streets
women, who, setting law and decency at defiance, actually have
the impudence to show themselves in public with their faces
unvarnished, and such as nature made them.&nbsp; Those, however,
who permit themselves this license, are in very ill odour, and
always take care to get out of the way of the police.</p>
<p>It is said that the edict of the Nomekhan has been greatly
promotive of the public morality.&nbsp; We are not in a position
to affirm the contrary, with decision, but we can affirm that the
Thibetians are far indeed from being exemplary in the matter of
morality.&nbsp; <!-- page 143--><a name="page143"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 143</span>There is lamentable licentiousness
amongst them, and we are disposed to believe that the blackest
and ugliest varnish is powerless to make corrupt people
virtuous.&nbsp; Christianity can alone redeem the pagan nations
from the shameful vices in which they wallow.</p>
<p>At the same time, there is one circumstance which may induce
us to believe that in Thibet there is less corruption than in
certain other pagan countries.&nbsp; The women there enjoy very
great liberty.&nbsp; Instead of vegetating, prisoners in the
depths of their houses, they lead an active and laborious
life.&nbsp; Besides fulfilling the various duties of the
household, they concentrate in their own hands all the petty
trade of the country, whether as hawkers, as stall-keepers in the
streets, or in shops.&nbsp; In the rural districts, it is the
women who perform most of the labours of agriculture.</p>
<p>The men, though less laborious and less active than the women,
are still far from passing their lives in idleness.&nbsp; They
occupy themselves especially with spinning and weaving
wool.&nbsp; The stuffs they manufacture, which are called poulou,
are of a very close and solid fabric; astonishingly various in
quality, from the coarsest cloths to the finest possible
Merino.&nbsp; By a rule of reformed Buddhism, every Lama must be
attired in red poulou.&nbsp; The consumption of the article in
Thibet itself is very large, and the caravans export considerable
quantities of it to Northern China and Tartary.&nbsp; The coarser
poulou is cheap, but the superior qualities are excessively
dear.</p>
<p>The pastile-sticks, so celebrated in China, under the name of
Tsan-Hiang (perfumes of Thibet), are an article of leading
commerce with the people of Lha-Ssa, who manufacture them with
the ash of various aromatic trees mixed with musk and gold
dust.&nbsp; Of these various ingredients, they elaborate a pink
paste, which is then moulded into small cylindrical sticks, three
or four feet long.&nbsp; These are burned in the Lamaseries, and
before the idols which are worshipped in private houses.&nbsp;
When these pastile-sticks are once lighted, they burn slowly,
without intermission, until they are completely consumed,
diffusing all around a perfume of the most exquisite
sweetness.&nbsp; The Thibetian merchants, who repair every year
to Peking in the train of the embassy, export considerable
quantities of it, which they sell at an exorbitant price.&nbsp;
The Northern Chinese manufacture pastile-sticks of their own,
which they sell equally under the name of Tsan-Hiang; but they
will sustain no comparison with those which come from Thibet.</p>
<p>The Thibetians have no porcelain, but they manufacture pottery
of all sorts in great perfection.&nbsp; As we have already
observed, their own breakfast, dinner, and tea service, consists
simply and entirely of a wooden cup, which each person carries
either in his bosom, or <!-- page 144--><a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>suspended
from his girdle in an ornamental purse.&nbsp; These cups are made
of the roots of certain fine trees that grow on the mountains of
Thibet.&nbsp; They are graceful in form, but simple and without
any sort of decoration, other than a slight varnish which
conceals neither their natural colour nor the veins of the
wood.&nbsp; Throughout Thibet, every one, from the poorest
mendicant up to the Tal&eacute;-Lama, takes his meals out of a
wooden cup.&nbsp; The Thibetians, indeed, make a distinction of
their own, unintelligible to Europeans, between these cups, some
of which are bought for a few small coins, while others cost up
to a hundred ounces of silver, or nearly &pound;40.&nbsp; If we
were asked what difference we had discerned between these various
qualities of cups, we should reply, most conscientiously, that
they all appeared to us pretty nearly of the same value, and that
with the best disposition in the world to be convinced, we had
utterly failed to perceive any distinction of moment between
them.&nbsp; The first-quality cups, however, according to the
Thibetians, have the property of neutralizing poisons.</p>
<p>Some days after our arrival at Lha-Ssa, desirous of renewing
our meal-service, which had become somewhat worn, we went into a
cup-shop.&nbsp; A Thibetian dame, her face elaborately varnished
with black, sat behind the counter.&nbsp; The lady, judging from
our exotic appearance, probably, that we were personages of
distinction, opened a drawer and took out two small boxes,
artistically executed, each of which contained a cup, thrice
enveloped in soft paper.&nbsp; After examining the goods with a
certain degree of suspense, we asked the price: &ldquo;Tchik-la,
gatse resi?&rdquo;&nbsp; (How much a-piece?)&nbsp;
&ldquo;Excellency, fifty ounces of silver each.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
words came upon us like a thunder-clap, that filled our ears with
a buzzing noise, and our eyes with a conviction that the shop was
turning round.&nbsp; Our entire fortune would scarcely have
purchased four of these wooden cups.&nbsp; Upon coming somewhat
to ourselves, we respectfully restored the two precious bowls to
their respective boxes, and passed in review the numerous
collection that was unceremoniously displayed on the shelves of
the shop.&nbsp; &ldquo;And these, how much are they
each?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Excellency, two for an ounce of
silver.&rdquo;&nbsp; We forthwith disbursed the ounce of silver,
and carried off, in triumph, the two wooden cups, which appeared
to us precisely the same as those for which we had been asked
&pound;20 a-piece.&nbsp; On our return home, the master of the
house, to whom we showed our purchase, gratified us with the
information, that for an ounce of silver we ought to have had at
least four such cups as the two we had received.</p>
<p>Poulou, pastile-sticks, and wooden-cups, are the three
principal branches of industry which the Thibetians successfully
prosecute.&nbsp; Their other manufactures are so poor and coarse
as to be unworthy <!-- page 145--><a name="page145"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 145</span>
<a href="images/p145.jpg">
<img class='clearcenter' alt=
"Thibetian Cup-shop"

</a> of any special mention.&nbsp; Their agricultural productions
scarcely merit notice.&nbsp; Thibet, almost entirely covered with
mountains, or cut up with impetuous torrents, affords to its
population very little cultivable space.&nbsp; It is only in the
valleys that anything like a harvest can be expected.&nbsp; The
Thibetians cultivate little wheat, and still less rice.&nbsp; The
chief production is Tsing-Kou, or black barley, of which is made
the tsamba, that basis of the aliment of the entire Thibetian
population, rich and poor.&nbsp; The town of Lha-Ssa itself is
abundantly supplied with sheep, horses, and oxen.&nbsp; There is
excellent fish, also, sold there, and pork, of most exquisite
flavour; but for the most part so dear as to be quite out of the
reach of the humbler classes.&nbsp; In fact, the Thibetians, as a
rule, live very poorly.&nbsp; Their ordinary repast is buttered
tea and tsamba, mixed coarsely together with the finger.&nbsp;
The richest people observe the same diet; it is quite pitiable to
see them swallowing such miserable provender out of cups, some of
which have cost &pound;40.&nbsp; Meat, when eaten at all, is not
eaten with the ordinary repasts, but apart, as a luxurious
specialty, in the same way that elsewhere <!-- page 146--><a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>people eat
costly fruit, or extra fine pastry, on these occasions.&nbsp;
There are usually served up two plates, one with boiled meat, the
other with raw meat, which the Thibetians devour with equal
appetite, unassisted by any seasoning whatever.&nbsp; They have,
however, wit enough not to eat without drinking.&nbsp; From time
to time they fill their dear wooden cups with a sort of acid
liquor, made of fermented barley, not at all disagreeable to the
palate.</p>
<p>Thibet, so poor in agricultural and manufacturing products, is
rich, beyond all imagination, in metals.&nbsp; Gold and silver
are collected there so readily, that the common shepherds have
become acquainted with the art of purifying these precious
metals.&nbsp; You often see them, in the ravines, or in the
hollows of the mountains, seated round a fire of argols, amusing
themselves with purifying in a rude crucible the gold-dust they
have found while tending their herds.&nbsp; The result of this
abundance of the precious metals is, that specie is of low value,
and that, consequently, goods always maintain a very high
price.&nbsp; The monetary system of the Thibetians consists
entirely of silver coins, which are somewhat larger, but not so
thick as our francs.&nbsp; On one side they bear inscriptions in
Thibetian, Parsee, or Indian characters; on the other, a crown
composed of eight small, round flowers.&nbsp; To facilitate
commerce, these coins are cut into pieces, the number of flowers
remaining on each piece determining its value.&nbsp; The entire
coin is called Tchan-Ka.&nbsp; A Tche-Ptche is one-half of the
Tchan-Ka; or, in other words, is a piece of four flowers
only.&nbsp; The Cho-Kan has five flowers, the Ka-Gan three.&nbsp;
In the larger commercial operations, they employ silver ingots,
which are weighed in a Roman balance, upon the decimal
system.&nbsp; Generally speaking, the Thibetians reckon up
accounts upon their beads; some people, however, and especially
the merchants, use the Chinese Souan-pan, while the learned
employ the numerals which the Europeans call Arabic, and which
appear to have been of very ancient date in Thibet.&nbsp; We have
seen several Lamanesque manuscripts, illustrated with
astronomical figures and diagrams, all of them represented by
Arabic numerals, which were also used in the paging of the
volumes.&nbsp; Some of these figures differed slightly from the
Arabic numerals used in Europe; the most marked difference we
noticed was that of the 5, which, in these manuscripts, was
turned upside down, thus: 
<a href="images/p146.jpg">
<img alt=
"Upside-down five"
title=
"Upside-down five"
src="images/p146.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>From the few details we have thus given as to the productions
of Thibet, it may be concluded that this country is perhaps the
richest, and, at the same time, the poorest in the world; rich in
gold and silver, poor in all that constitutes the well-being of
the masses.&nbsp; The gold and silver collected by the people is
absorbed <!-- page 147--><a name="page147"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 147</span>by the great people, and especially
by the Lamaseries, those immense reservoirs, into which flow, by
a thousand channels, all the wealth of these vast regions.&nbsp;
The Lamas, invested with the major part of the currency, by the
voluntary donations of the faithful, centruple their fortunes by
usury that puts even Chinese knavery to the blush.&nbsp; The
offerings they receive are converted, as it were, into hooks,
with which they catch the purses out of every one&rsquo;s
pocket.&nbsp; Money being thus accumulated in the coffers of the
privileged classes, and, on the other hand, the necessaries of
life being only procurable at a very high price, it results from
this capital disorder, that a great proportion of the population
is constantly plunged in the most frightful destitution.&nbsp; At
Lha-Ssa the number of mendicants is very considerable.&nbsp; They
go from door to door, soliciting a handful of tsamba, and enter
any one&rsquo;s house, without the least ceremony.&nbsp; Their
manner of asking charity is to hold out the closed hand, with the
thumb raised.&nbsp; We must add, in commendation of the
Thibetians, that they are generally very kind and compassionate,
rarely sending away the poor unassisted.</p>
<p>Among the foreigners settled at Lha-Ssa, the Pebouns are the
most numerous.&nbsp; These are Indians from the vicinity of
Boutan, on the other side of the Himalaya mountains.&nbsp; They
are of slight frame, but very vigorous, active, and animated;
their features are rounder than those of the Thibetians: the
complexion very dark, the eyes small, black, and roguish; the
forehead is marked with a dark, cherry-coloured spot, which they
renew every morning.&nbsp; They are all attired in a uniform robe
of pink poulou, with a small felt cap of the same colour, but of
somewhat darker tint.&nbsp; When they go out, they add to their
costume a long red scarf, which twice encircles the neck like a
great collar, and the two ends of which are thrown back over the
shoulders.</p>
<p>The Pebouns are the only workers in metals at Lha-Ssa.&nbsp;
It is in their quarter that you must seek the iron-smiths, the
braziers, the plumbers, the tinmen, the founders, the goldsmiths,
the jewellers, the machinists, and even the physicians and
chemists.&nbsp; Their workshops and laboratories are nearly
underground.&nbsp; You enter them by a low, narrow opening, down
three or four steps.&nbsp; Over the doors of all their houses,
you see a painting representing a red globe, and below it a white
crescent.&nbsp; These manifestly signify the sun and moon; but
the particular allusions conveyed we omitted to ascertain.</p>
<p>You find, among the Pebouns, artists very distinguished in
metallurgy.&nbsp; They manufacture all sorts of vases, in gold
and silver, for the use of the Lamaseries, and jewellery of every
<!-- page 148--><a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>description that certainly would reflect no discredit
upon European artists.&nbsp; It is they who construct for the
Buddhist temples those fine roofs of gilt plates, which resist
all the inclemencies of the seasons, and always retain a
marvellous freshness and glitter.&nbsp; They are so skilful at
this class of work, that they are sent to the very interior of
Tartary to decorate the great Lamaseries.&nbsp; The Pebouns are
also the dyers of Lha-Ssa.&nbsp; Their colours are vivid and
enduring; stuffs upon which they have operated may wear out, but
they never lose their colour.&nbsp; They are only permitted,
however, to dye the poulou.&nbsp; All stuffs coming from foreign
countries must be worn as they are, the government absolutely
prohibiting the dyers from at all exercising their industry upon
them.&nbsp; The object of this prohibition is probably the
encouragement of the stuffs manufactured at Lha-Ssa.</p>
<p>The Pebouns are in disposition extremely jovial and
child-like.&nbsp; In their hours of relaxation they are full of
laughter and frolic; and even while at work they are constantly
singing.&nbsp; Their religion is Indian Buddhism.&nbsp; Although
they have not adopted the reformation of Tsong-Kaba, they respect
the Lamanesque ceremonies and rites.&nbsp; They never fail, on
all the more solemn occasions, to prostrate themselves at the
feet of the Buddha-La, and to offer their adorations to the
Tal&eacute;-Lama.</p>
<p>Next to the Peboun, you remark at Lha-Ssa, the Katchi, or
Mussulmen, from Cashmere&mdash;their turban, their large beard,
their grave, solemn step, their physiognomy full of intelligence
and majesty, the neatness and richness of their
attire,&mdash;everything about them presents an emphatic contrast
with the peoples of inferior race, by whom they are
surrounded.&nbsp; They have at Lha-Ssa a governor, to whom they
are immediately subject, and whose authority is recognised by the
Thibetian government.&nbsp; This officer is, at the same time,
the local head of the Mussulman religion; so that his countrymen
consider him, in this foreign land, at once their pacha and their
mufti.&nbsp; The Katchi have been established at Lha-Ssa for
several centuries, having originally abandoned their own country,
in order to escape the persecutions of a certain pacha of
Cashmere, whose despotism had become intolerable to them; and the
children of these first emigrants found themselves so well off in
Thibet, that they never thought of returning to their own
country.&nbsp; The descendants still keep up a correspondence
with Cashmere, but the intelligence they receive thence is little
calculated to give them any desire to renounce their adopted
country.&nbsp; The Katchi governor, with whom we got upon very
intimate terms, told us that the Pelings of Calcutta (the
English), were now the real masters of Cashmere.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
Pelings,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;are the most <!-- page 149--><a
name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>cunning
people in the world.&nbsp; Little by little they are acquiring
possession of all the countries of India, but it is always rather
by stratagem than by open force.&nbsp; Instead of overthrowing
the authorities, they cleverly manage to get them on their side,
to enlist them in their interest.&nbsp; Hence it is that, in
Cashmere, the saying is: The world is Allah&rsquo;s, the land the
Pacha&rsquo;s; it is the company that rules.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Katchi are the richest merchants at Lha-Ssa.&nbsp; All the
establishments for the sale of linen, and other goods for
personal and other use, belong to them.&nbsp; They are also
money-changers, and traffic in gold and silver: hence it is that
you almost always find Parsee characters on the Thibetian
coinage.&nbsp; Every year, some of their number proceed to
Calcutta for commercial operations, they being the only class who
are permitted to pass the frontiers to visit the English.&nbsp;
On these occasions they are furnished with a passport from the
Tal&eacute;-Lama, and a Thibetian escort accompanies them to the
foot of the Himalaya mountains.&nbsp; The goods, however, which
they bring from Calcutta, are of very limited extent, consisting
merely of ribands, galloons, knives, scissors, and some other
articles of cutlery and ironmongery, and a small assortment of
cotton goods.&nbsp; The silks and linens in their warehouses, and
of which they have a large sale at Lha-Ssa, come from Peking by
the medium of the caravans; the linen goods, being Russian, come
to them much cheaper than they buy them at Calcutta.</p>
<p>The Katchi have a mosque at Lha-Ssa, and are rigid observers
of the law of Mahomet&mdash;openly and even ostentatiously
expressing their contempt for all the superstitious practices of
the Buddhists.&nbsp; The first Katchi who arrived at Lha-Ssa
married Thibetian wives, whom they compelled to renounce their
own religion, and to embrace Mahometanism.&nbsp; But now, the
rule with them is only to contract marriage alliances amongst
themselves; so that there has imperceptibly become formed, in the
heart of Thibet, a small nation apart, having neither the
costume, nor the manners, nor the language, nor the religion of
the natives.&nbsp; As they do not prostrate themselves before the
Tal&eacute;-Lama, and do not pray in the Lamaseries, everybody
says they are infidels; but as, for the most part, they are rich
and powerful, people stand aside in the streets to let them pass,
and put out their tongues to them in token of respect.&nbsp; In
Thibet, when you desire to salute any one, you take off your hat,
put out your tongue, and scratch the right ear, all three
operations being performed simultaneously.</p>
<p>The Chinese you find at Lha-Ssa are for the most part soldiers
or officers of the tribunals; those who fix their residence in
this <!-- page 150--><a name="page150"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 150</span>town are very few in number.&nbsp;
At all times the Chinese and the Thibetians have had relations
more or less important: they frequently have waged war against
each other, and have tried to encroach upon one another&rsquo;s
rights.&nbsp; The Tartar-Mantchou dynasty, as we have already
remarked elsewhere, saw from the commencement of their elevation
the great importance of conciliating the friendship of the
Tal&eacute;-Lama, whose influence is all-powerful over the Mongol
tribes; consequently, they have never failed to retain at the
court of Lha-Ssa two Grand Mandarins invested with the title of
Kin-Tchai, which signifies ambassador, or
envoy-extraordinary.&nbsp; The ostensible mission of these
individuals is to present, under certain fixed circumstances, the
homage of the Chinese Emperor to the Tal&eacute;-Lama, and to
lend him the aid of China in any difficulties he may have with
his neighbours.&nbsp; Such, to all appearance, is the purport of
this permanent embassy; but in reality they are only in
attendance to flatter the religious belief of the Mongols, and to
bind them to the reigning dynasty, by making them believe that
the government of Peking has great veneration for the divinity of
the Buddha-La.&nbsp; Another advantage of this embassy is, that
the two Kin-Tchais can easily, at Lha-Ssa, watch the movements of
the people on the confines of the empire, and send information of
them to their government.</p>
<p>In the thirty-fifth year of the reign of Kien-Long, the court
of Peking had at Lha-Ssa two Kin-Tchai, or ambassadors, the one
named Lo, the other Pou; by a combination of the two names, these
men were called the Kin-Tchais (<i>Lo-Pou</i>).&nbsp; The word
Lo-Pou signifying in Thibetian &ldquo;radish.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
term was, to a certain extent, an insult, and the people of
Lha-Ssa, who had never regarded with a pleased eye the presence
of the Chinese in the country, were delighted to take up this
denomination.&nbsp; Besides, for some time past, the two Chinese
Mandarins had given, by their behaviour, umbrage to the
Thibetians; they interfered every day, more and more, in the
affairs of the state, and openly encroached on the rights of the
Tal&eacute;-Lama.&nbsp; At last, as a climax of annoyance, they
ordered numerous Chinese troops into Thibet, under the pretext of
protecting the Tal&eacute;-Lama from certain Nepaulese tribes who
were giving him uneasiness.&nbsp; It was easy to see that China
sought to extend its empire and dominion into Thibet.&nbsp; The
opposition of the Thibetian government was, they say, terrible,
and the Nomekhan exerted all his authority to check the
usurpation of the two Kin-Tchai.&nbsp; One day, as he was going
to the palace of the Chinese ambassadors, a young Lama threw a
note into his litter, on which were written the words, <i>Lo Pou,
ma, sa</i>, which signifies, Do not eat radishes&mdash;abstain
from radishes.&nbsp; The <!-- page 151--><a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>Nomekhan
clearly saw, that by this play upon words, some one wished to
advise him to be on his guard against the Kin-Tchais (Lo-Pou);
but as the warning was not clear or precise, he went on.&nbsp;
Whilst he was in secret conversation with the two delegates of
the court of Peking, some satellites suddenly entered the
apartment, poinarded the Nomekhan, and cut off his head.&nbsp; A
Thibetian cook, who was in an adjoining room, ran, on hearing the
victim&rsquo;s cries, took possession of the bleeding head, stuck
it on a pike, and 
<a href="images/p151.jpg">
<img class='clearcenter' alt=
"Insurrection of the Thibetians at Lha-Ssa"
title=
"Insurrection of the Thibetians at Lha-Ssa"
src="images/p151.jpg" />
</a> ran through the streets of Lha-Ssa, crying,
&ldquo;Vengeance&mdash;death to the Chinese!&rdquo;&nbsp; The
whole town was raised; all rushed to arms, and went tumultuously
to the palace of the Kin-Tchai, who were cut in pieces.&nbsp; The
fury of the people was so great, that they attacked,
indiscriminately, all the Chinese, and hunted them down like wild
beasts&mdash;not only at Lha-Ssa, but also at the other places in
Thibet, where they had established military stations, making a
ruthless butchery of them.&nbsp; The Thibetians, it is said, did
not lay <!-- page 152--><a name="page152"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 152</span>down their arms till they had
pitilessly pursued and massacred all the Chinese to the very
frontiers of Sse-Tchouen and Yun-Nan.</p>
<p>The news of this frightful catastrophe having reached the
court of Peking, the Emperor Kien-Long immediately ordered large
levies of troops throughout the empire, and had them marched
against Thibet.&nbsp; The Chinese, as in almost all the wars they
have waged with their neighbours, were worsted, but they were
successful in negociation.&nbsp; Matters were replaced on their
former footing, and since then, peace has never been seriously
disturbed between the two governments.</p>
<p>The military force which the Chinese keep up in Thibet is
inconsiderable.&nbsp; From Sse-Tchouen to Lha-Ssa, they have, at
each stage, miserable barracks, designed to facilitate the
journeys of the imperial couriers.&nbsp; In the town of Lha-Ssa,
their garrison consists of a few hundred soldiers, whose presence
contributes to adorn and protect the position of the
ambassadors.&nbsp; From Lha-Ssa, going towards the south as far
as Boutan, they have also a line of barracks, very badly
kept.&nbsp; On the frontiers, they guard, conjointly with the
Thibetian troops, the high mountains which separate Thibet from
the first English stations.&nbsp; In the other parts of Thibet
there are no Chinese, their entrance thither being strictly
forbidden.</p>
<p>The soldiers and the Chinese Mandarins established in Thibet
are in the pay of the government of Peking; they generally remain
three years in the country.&nbsp; When this time has elapsed
others are sent to replace them, and they return to their
respective provinces.&nbsp; There are some of them, however, who,
on the termination of their service, obtain leave to settle at
Lha-Ssa, or in the towns on the road to Sse-Tchouen.&nbsp; The
Chinese at Lha-Ssa are very few in number; and it would be rather
difficult to say to what profession they attach themselves to
make their living.&nbsp; Generally speaking, they are
jacks-of-all-trades, having a thousand ways of transferring to
their own purses the tchan-kas of the Thibetians.&nbsp; Many of
them take a wife in the country; but the bonds of marriage are
inadequate to fix them for life in their adopted country.&nbsp;
After a certain number of years, when they consider they have
accumulated enough, they return to China, and leave behind them
wife and children, excepting the sons, whom they would scruple to
abandon.&nbsp; The Thibetians fear the Chinese, the Katchi
despise them, the Peboun laugh at them.</p>
<p>Of the several classes of strangers sojourning at, or merely
visiting Lha-Ssa, there was no one to which we seemed to belong;
we resembled no one.&nbsp; Accordingly, from the first day of our
arrival, we observed that the strangeness of our physiognomy
attracted <!-- page 153--><a name="page153"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 153</span>general attention.&nbsp; When we
passed along the streets the people looked at us with
astonishment, and then advanced, in an under tone, various
hypotheses as to our nation.&nbsp; At one time, they took us for
two Muftis lately come from Cashmere; at another time for two
Indian 
<a href="images/p153.jpg">
<img class='clearcenter' alt=
"Chinese Mandarin and his wife"
title=

src="images/p153.jpg" />
</a> Brahmins; some said we were Lamas from the north of Tartary;
others maintained that we were merchants from Peking, and that we
had disguised ourselves in order to accompany the Thibetian
embassy.&nbsp; But all these suppositions soon vanished, for we
formally declared to the Katchi that we were neither Mufti nor
Cashmerians; to <!-- page 154--><a name="page154"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 154</span>the Peboun, that we were neither
Indians nor Brahmins; to the Mongols, that we were neither Lamas
nor Tartars; to the Chinese, that we were neither merchants, nor
from the Central Kingdom.&nbsp; When all were fully convinced
that we did not belong to any of these categories they began to
call us White Azaras.&nbsp; The denomination was very
picturesque, and rather pleased us; we were not, however,
inclined to adopt it before getting some information on the
point.&nbsp; We therefore asked what they meant by White
Azaras.&nbsp; The answer we got was that the Azaras were the most
fervent of all the adorers of Buddha, that they were a large
tribe of Indians, and that out of devotion they often made a
pilgrimage to Lha-Ssa.&nbsp; It was added, that as we were
neither Thibetians, nor Katchi, nor Peboun, nor Tartars, nor
Chinese, we must certainly be Azaras.&nbsp; There was only this
little difficulty in the way, that the Azaras who had previously
been at Lha-Ssa, were black; it had become necessary, therefore,
in order to solve the difficulty, to call us White Azaras.&nbsp;
We again rendered homage to the truth, and declared that we were
not Azaras of any kind, white or black.&nbsp; All these doubts
about our origin were at first amusing enough; but they soon
became serious.&nbsp; Some ill-disposed persons went on to
consider that we must be Russians or English, and ultimately
almost everybody honoured us with the latter qualification.&nbsp;
It was set forth, without further hesitation, that we were
Pelings from Calcutta, that we had come to investigate the
strength of Thibet, to make maps, and to devise means to get
possession of the country.&nbsp; All national prejudice apart, it
was very annoying to us to be taken for the subjects of her
Britannic Majesty.&nbsp; Such a <i>quid-pro-quo</i> could not but
render us very unpopular, and, perhaps, end in our being cut to
pieces; for the Thibetians, why, we know not, have taken it into
their heads that the English are an encroaching people, who are
not to be trusted.</p>
<p>To cut short the various chatter circulated about us, we
resolved to conform to a regulation in force at Lha-Ssa, and
which commands all strangers, who are desirous of staying in the
town, to present themselves to the authorities.&nbsp; We went
accordingly to the chief of police, and declared to him that we
belonged to the Western Heaven, to a great kingdom called France,
and that we had come to Thibet to preach the Christian religion,
of which we were the ministers.&nbsp; The person to whom we made
this declaration was cold and impenetrable as became a
bureaucrat.&nbsp; He phlegmatically drew his bamboo quill from
behind his ear, and began to write, without the slightest
observation, what we had told him.&nbsp; He contented himself
with repeating twice or thrice, between his teeth, the words
&ldquo;France,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Christian religion,&rdquo; like
a man <!-- page 155--><a name="page155"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 155</span>who does not know what you
mean.&nbsp; When he had done writing, he wiped his pen, still wet
with ink, in his hair, and replaced it behind his right ear,
saying, &ldquo;Yak poze&rdquo; (very well); &ldquo;Temou
chu&rdquo; (dwell in peace), we replied, and putting out our
tongues at him, we left him, delighted at having placed ourselves
on a proper footing with the police.&nbsp; We then walked about
the streets of Lha-Ssa with a firmer and more assured step, and
regardless of the remarks that continually assailed our
ears.&nbsp; The lawful position we had established raised us in
our own eyes, and restored our courage.&nbsp; What a happiness at
length to find ourselves in a hospitable land, and to be able to
breathe a free air, after living so long in China; always in
constraint, always outside the law, always occupied with plans
for tricking the government of his Imperial Majesty.</p>
<p>The sort of indifference with which our declaration was
received by the Thibetian authorities did not surprise us in the
least.&nbsp; From the information we had received of the position
of strangers at Lha-Ssa, we were convinced we should have no
difficulty in the matter.&nbsp; The Thibetians do not profess, in
regard to other people, those principles of exclusion which
constitute the distinctive character of the Chinese nation.&nbsp;
Everyone is allowed to enter Lha-Ssa; everyone can go and come,
and engage in commerce and industrial pursuits without the least
restraint.&nbsp; If entrance into Thibet is forbidden to the
Chinese, this prohibition must be attributed to the government of
Peking, which, to show its complete adherence to its narrow and
suspicious policy, forbids its subjects to penetrate among other
nations.&nbsp; It is probable that the English would not be
excluded more than any other nation, had not their invasive march
into Hindostan inspired the Tal&eacute;-Lama with a natural
terror.</p>
<p>We have already mentioned the many and striking analogies
between the Lamanesque worship and the Catholic rites&mdash;Rome
and Lha-Ssa&mdash;the pope and the Tal&eacute;-Lama, <a
name="citation155"></a><a href="#footnote155"
class="citation">[155]</a> might furnish further analogies.&nbsp;
The Thibetian government, being purely Lamanesque, seems in some
sort framed upon the ecclesiastical government of the Pontifical
states.&nbsp; The Tal&eacute;-Lama is the political and religious
head of all the Thibetian countries; in his hands is all the
legislative, executive, and administrative power.&nbsp; The
common law and some rules left by Tsong-Kaba, serve to direct him
in the exercise of his immense authority.&nbsp; When the
Tal&eacute;-Lama dies, or, in the <!-- page 156--><a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>language of
the Buddhists, when he transmigrates, a child is selected who is
to continue the imperishable personification of the Living
Buddha.&nbsp; This election is made by the grand assembly of the
Houtouktou Lamas, whose sacerdotal dignity is only inferior to
that of the Tal&eacute;-Lama.&nbsp; By-and-by we will enter more
fully into the form and rules of this singular election.&nbsp; As
the Tal&eacute;-Lama is not only the religious and political
sovereign of the Thibetians, but also their visible deity, it is
obvious that he cannot, without seriously compromising his
divinity, descend from the height of his sanctuary, to meddle, on
all occasions, with human affairs.&nbsp; He has, therefore,
reserved to himself the matters of primary importance, content to
reign much, and to govern very little.&nbsp; The exercise of his
authority wholly depends on his will and pleasure.&nbsp; There is
no charter or constitution to regulate his conduct.</p>
<p>After the Tal&eacute;-Lama, whom the Thibetians also call
Kian-Ngan-Remboutchi (sovereign treasure), comes the Nomekhan, or
Spiritual Emperor.&nbsp; The Chinese give him the name of
Tsan-Wang, king of Thibet.&nbsp; This personage is nominated by
the Tal&eacute;-Lama, and must be selected from the class of
Chaberon Lamas.&nbsp; He retains office for life, and can only be
overthrown by some state stroke.&nbsp; All the affairs of the
government are managed by the Nomekhan, and four ministers called
Kalons.&nbsp; The Kalons are chosen by the Tal&eacute;-Lama, from
a list of candidates made out by the Nomekhan; they do not belong
to the sacerdotal tribe, and may marry; the duration of their
power is unlimited.&nbsp; When they render themselves unworthy of
their office, the Nomekhan sends a report to the
Tal&eacute;-Lama, who dismisses them, if he thinks proper.&nbsp;
The subaltern functionaries are selected by the Kalons, and most
frequently belong to the class of Lamas.</p>
<p>The provinces are divided into several principalities, which
are governed by Houtouktou Lamas.&nbsp; These petty
ecclesiastical sovereigns receive their investiture from the
Tal&eacute;-Lama, and recognise his sovereign authority.&nbsp;
Generally they are of a warlike turn, and frequently engage with
their neighbours, in hostile skirmishes, which are always
accompanied by pillage and conflagration.</p>
<p>The most potent of these Lama sovereigns is the
Bandchan-Remboutchi.&nbsp; He resides at Djachi-Loumbo (mountain
of oracles), capital of Further Thibet.&nbsp; This town is
situated south of Lha-Ssa, and is only eight days journey from
it.&nbsp; The celebrity of the present Bandchan is prodigious;
his partisans assert that his spiritual power is as great as that
of the Tal&eacute;-Lama, and that the sanctuary of Djachi-Loumbo
does not yield in sanctity to that of the Buddha-La.&nbsp; It is
generally, however, admitted, that the temporal power of the
Tal&eacute;-Lama is superior to that of the
Bandchan-Remboutchi.&nbsp; <!-- page 157--><a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>Great
rivalry will not fail to manifest itself, sooner or later,
between Lha-Ssa and Djachi-Loumbo, and occasion dismal
dissensions among the Thibetians.</p>
<p>The present Bandchan-Remboutchi is sixty years of age; he is,
they say, of a fine and majestic frame, and astonishingly
vigorous for his advanced age.&nbsp; This singular personage
states himself to be of Indian origin, and that it is already
some thousands of years since his first incarnation took place in
the celebrated country of the Azaras.&nbsp; The physiognomists
who, at our first coming to Lha-Ssa, took us for white Azaras,
failed not to urge us to go and offer our devotions to the
Djachi-Loumbo, assuring us, that in our quality of countrymen of
the Bandchan-Remboutchi, we should have a very good
reception.&nbsp; The learned Lamas, who occupy themselves with
Buddhic genealogies, explain how the Bandchan, after numerous and
marvellous incarnations in Hindostan, ended by appearing in
Further Thibet, and fixing his residence at Djachi-Loumbo.&nbsp;
Whatever may be his biography, which, fortunately we are not
bound to believe in, it is certain that this able Lama has
managed to establish an astonishing reputation.&nbsp; The
Thibetians, the Tartars, and the other Buddhists call him by no
other name than the Great Saint, and never pronounce his name
without clasping their hands and raising their eyes to
heaven.&nbsp; They pretend that his knowledge is universal.&nbsp;
He knows how to speak, they say, all the languages of the
universe without having ever studied them, and can converse with
pilgrims from all parts of the world.&nbsp; The Tartars have so
strong a faith in his power, that they invoke him
continually.&nbsp; In dangers, in afflictions, in all matters of
difficulty, they have in their mouths the magic word bokte
(saint).</p>
<p>The pilgrims who come to Thibet never fail to visit the
Djachi-Loumbo, to prostrate themselves at the feet of the saint
of saints, and to present to him their offerings.&nbsp; No one
can form a notion of the enormous sums which the Tartar caravans
bring him every year.&nbsp; In return for the ingots of gold and
silver which he shuts up in his coffers, the Bandchan distributes
among his adorers shreds of his old clothes, bits of paper
printed with Mongol or Thibetian sentences, earthen statuettes,
and red pills of infallible efficaciousness against all sorts of
maladies.&nbsp; The pilgrims receive with veneration these
trifles, and deposit them religiously in a bag which they always
have hanging from their necks.</p>
<p>Those who make the pilgrimage to Djachi-Loumbo, seculars or
Lamas, men or women, all enrol themselves in the society of
Kalons, instituted by the Bandchan-Remboutchi.&nbsp; Almost all
the Buddhists aspire to the happiness of becoming members of this
<!-- page 158--><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>association, which will give rise, some day, to some
important event in Upper Asia.&nbsp; All minds, even now, are
vividly occupied with the presentiment of a grand
catastrophe.&nbsp; Here are some of the strange prophecies that
are current on this subject.</p>
<p>When the saint of Djachi-Loumbo, when the Bandchan-Remboutchi
dies, he will not transmigrate as heretofore, in Further
Thibet.&nbsp; His new incarnation will take place to the north of
Lha-Ssa, in the steppes inhabited by the Ourianghai, in the
country called Thien-Chan-P&eacute;-Lou, between the Celestial
Mountains and the chains of the Altai.&nbsp; While he remains
there, a few years incognito, preparing himself by retirement,
prayer, and good works, for the great events of the future, the
religion of Buddha will continue to grow weaker and weaker in all
men&rsquo;s hearts; it will only exist in the bosoms of the
brotherhood of the Kalons.&nbsp; At this disastrous epoch the
Chinese will gain influence in Thibet; they will spread
themselves over the mountains and through the valleys, and will
seek to possess themselves of the empire of the
Tal&eacute;-Lama.&nbsp; But this state of things will soon pass
away; there will he a general rise of the people; the Thibetians
will take up arms, and will massacre in one day all the Chinese,
young and old, and not one of them shall repass the
frontiers.</p>
<p>A year after this sanguinary day, the Chinese Emperor will
raise innumerable battalions, and will lead them against the
Thibetians.&nbsp; There will be a terrible reaction; blood will
flow in torrents, the streams will be red with gore, and the
Chinese will gain possession of Thibet.&nbsp; But this triumph
will not be of long duration.&nbsp; Then it will be that the
Bandchan-Remboutchi will manifest his power.&nbsp; He will summon
all the Kalons of the holy society.&nbsp; Those who shall have
already died will return to life, and they will all assemble in a
vast plain of Thien-Chan-P&eacute;-Lou.&nbsp; There the Bandchan
will distribute arrows and fusils to all of them, and will form
of this multitude a formidable army of which he himself will take
the command.&nbsp; The society of Kalons will march with the
Saint of Saints, and will throw themselves on the Chinese, who
will be cut to pieces.&nbsp; Thibet will be conquered, then
China, then Tartary, and finally, the vast empire of the
Oros.&nbsp; The Bandchan will be proclaimed universal sovereign,
and under his holy influence Lamanism will be soon restored to
its pristine vigour, superb Lamaseries will rise everywhere, and
the whole world will recognise the infinite power of Buddhic
prayers.</p>
<p>These predictions, of which we content ourselves with giving a
mere summary, are related by every one in most minute detail; but
what is most surprising is, that no one seems to entertain the
least doubt of the full accomplishment of the events they
foretell.&nbsp; Every <!-- page 159--><a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>one speaks of them as of things
certain and infallible.&nbsp; The Chinese residing at Lha-Ssa
seem likewise to attach credit to the prediction, but they take
good care not to trouble their heads much about it; they hope
that the crisis will not come for a long while, that by that time
they may be dead, or at least be able to anticipate it.&nbsp; As
for the Bandchan-Remboutchi, they say he is preparing himself
vigorously for the grand revolution of which he is destined to be
the soul.&nbsp; Although already advanced in years he often
practices military exercises: every moment which is not absorbed
by his high functions as Living Buddha he employs in making
himself familiar with his future position of generalissimo of the
Kalons.&nbsp; They affirm that he shoots an arrow very skilfully,
and that he handles with great dexterity the lance and the
matchlock.&nbsp; He breeds large herds of horses for his future
cavalry, and packs of enormous dogs, which, combining prodigious
strength with superior intelligence, are destined to play an
important part in the grand army of the Kalons.</p>
<p>These absurd and extravagant ideas have so made their way with
the masses, and particularly with those who belong to the society
of the Kalons, that they are very likely, at some future day, to
cause a revolution in Thibet.&nbsp; It is never without result
that people thus preoccupy their minds with the future.&nbsp;
After the death of the Grand Lama of Djachi-Loumbo, a reckless
adventurer will only have to proceed to Thien-Chan-P&eacute;-Lou,
boldly proclaim himself Bandchan-Remboutchi, and summon the
Kalons together&mdash;nothing more will, probably, be required to
raise these fanatical people.</p>
<p>An actual and immediate result of this society of the Kalons
is to give the Bandchan-Remboutchi an importance which seems by
slow degrees to be compromising the supremacy of the
Tal&eacute;-Lama.&nbsp; This result is the more feasible, that
the sovereign of Lha-Ssa is a child of nine years old, and that
his three predecessors have fallen victims to a violent death
before attaining their majority, which is fixed by the laws at
twenty years of age.&nbsp; The Bandchan-Remboutchi, who seems to
be an able and ambitious man, will not have failed to take
advantage of these four minorities to confiscate to his own
advantage a portion of the spiritual and temporal power of the
Tal&eacute;-Lama.</p>
<p>The violent death of the three Tal&eacute;-Lamas, the
immediate predecessors of the reigning sovereign, gave rise, in
the year 1844, to an event which occupied the attention of all
Thibet, Tartary, and even China, and which, on account of its
importance, deserves, perhaps, a brief notice here.&nbsp; The
unprecedented phenomenon of three Tal&eacute;-Lamas dying
successively in the flower of their age, had plunged <!-- page
160--><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>the inhabitants of Lha-Ssa into a state of mournful
consternation.&nbsp; Gradually, dark rumours began to circulate,
and soon the words &ldquo;crime,&rdquo;
&ldquo;assassination,&rdquo; were heard.&nbsp; The thing went so
far that they related in the streets of the town and the
Lamaseries all the circumstances of these dismal events.&nbsp; It
was said that the first Tal&eacute;-Lama had been strangled, the
second crushed by the roof of his sleeping apartment, and the
third poisoned with his numerous relations, who had come to
settle at Lha-Ssa.&nbsp; The superior Lama of the Grand Lamasery
of Kaldan, who was very much attached to the Tal&eacute;-Lama,
had suffered the same fate.&nbsp; The public voice denounced the
Nomekhan as the author of all these crimes.&nbsp; The four
ministers had no doubt about the matter, knowing the whole truth;
but they found themselves unable to avenge the death of their
sovereign; they were too weak to struggle with the Nomekhan, who
was supported by numerous and powerful friends.</p>
<p>This Nomekhan was a Si-Fan, a native of the principality of
Yang-Tou-Sse, in the province of Kan-Sou.&nbsp; The supreme
dignity of Tou-Sse was hereditary in his family, and a great
number of his relations, settled at Lha-Ssa for several
generations, exercised great influence over the affairs of
Thibet.&nbsp; The Nomekhan of Yang-Tou-Sse was still very young
when he was invested with an authority inferior only to that of
the Tal&eacute;-Lama.&nbsp; They say that a few years after his
elevation to power, he manifested his ambitious sentiments and a
boundless desire for domination.&nbsp; He used his own great
wealth and the influence of his relations, to surround himself
with dependents wholly devoted to his interest.&nbsp; He took
particular care to secure partisans among the Lamas; and, to this
end, he took under his immediate protection the famous Lamasery
of Sera, situated half a league from Lha-Ssa, and containing
upwards of 15,000 Buddhist monks.&nbsp; He loaded it with
presents, granted it infinite privileges and revenues, and
placed, in its different departments, a great number of his
creatures.&nbsp; The Lamas of Sera failed not to acquire great
enthusiasm for the Nomekhan; they regarded him as a saint of the
first degree, and compiled an enumeration of his perfections as
extensive and pompous as that of the perfections of Buddha.&nbsp;
Supported by the powerful party he had got together, the Nomekhan
withdrew all bounds from his projects of usurpation.&nbsp; It was
then that he caused the three young Lamas to be murdered in
succession, in order to keep for himself the position of
Regent.&nbsp; Such was the Nomekhan of Yang-Tou-Sse, or rather,
such was he represented to us during our stay at Lha-Ssa.</p>
<p>It was not easy, as may be seen, to overthrow a personage
whose power was so solidly based.&nbsp; The Kalon ministers,
unequal <!-- page 161--><a name="page161"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 161</span>to an open struggle with the
Nomekhan, resolved to dissimulate, and to work, meanwhile, in
secret, at the downfall of this execrable man.&nbsp; The assembly
of the Houtouktou elected a new Tal&eacute;-Lama, or rather
indicated the child into whose body the soul of the Living Buddha
had transmigrated.&nbsp; He was enthroned at the summit of the
Buddha-La.&nbsp; The Nomekhan, like the other dignitaries,
proceeded to throw himself at his feet, worshipped him with all
devotion, but with the full resolution, doubtless, to make him
undergo a fourth transmigration, when he should think proper.</p>
<p>The Kalons secretly adopted measures to prevent a new
catastrophe.&nbsp; They consulted with the Bandchan-Remboutchi of
Djachi-Loumbo, and it was determined that, to check the infamous
projects of the Nomekhan, they should call to their aid the
irresistible power of the Emperor of China.&nbsp; A request was
accordingly drawn up and signed by the Bandchan and the four
Kalons, and privately sent to Peking by the embassy of
1844.&nbsp; For three special reasons the government of Peking
could not dispense with granting to the Thibetians the protection
they demanded under these grave circumstances.&nbsp; In the first
place the Tartaro-Mantchou dynasty had solemnly declared itself
protector of the Tal&eacute;-Lama; in the second place, the
Nomekhan, as being a native of Yang-Tou-Sse, in the province of
Kan-Sou, was in some degree amenable to the Chinese Emperor;
finally, politically speaking, it was an excellent opportunity
for the court of Peking to establish its influence in Thibet,
with a view to the realisation of its protects of usurpation.</p>
<p>The request sent to Peking by the Bandchan-Remboutchi and the
four Kalons, was received with all the favour that could be
desired, and the government there determined to send to Lha-Ssa
an ambassador of energy and prudence, capable of overthrowing the
power of the Nomekhan.&nbsp; The Emperor thought of the Mandarin
Ki-Chan, and charged him with this difficult mission.</p>
<p>Before proceeding further, it will not, perhaps, be
superfluous to give a sketch of this Ki-Chan, a very celebrated
personage in China, who has played an important part in the
affair of the English at Canton.&nbsp; Ki-Chan is of
Tartaro-Mantchou origin; he commenced his career as a scrivener
in one of the six grand tribunals of Peking.&nbsp; His rare
capacity was soon remarked, and although he was still very young,
he rapidly mounted all the steps of the magistracy.&nbsp; At the
age of twenty-two he was governor of the province of Ho-Nan; at
the age of twenty-five he was its viceroy, but he was dismissed
from this charge for not having been able to foresee an overflow
of the Yellow River, which caused great disasters in the province
that was entrusted to him.&nbsp; His disgrace did not last long;
he was reinstated in his former dignity, and sent, successively,
in <!-- page 162--><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>quality of viceroy, to the provinces of Chan-Tong-Sse
Tchouen, and Pe-Tche-Ly.&nbsp; He was decorated with the red
button, the peacock&rsquo;s feather, and the yellow tunic, with
the title of Heou-Ye (imperial prince).&nbsp; At length, he was
nominated Tchoung-Tang, the highest dignity to which a Mandarin
can ever aspire.&nbsp; They have only eight Tchoung-Tangs in the
empire; four Mantchous and four Chinese; these compose the privy
council of the Emperor, and have the right of direct
correspondence with him.</p>
<p>Towards the close of the year 1839, Ki-Chan was sent to
Canton, as viceroy of the province, and with the title of
imperial commissioner he had full powers to treat, in the name of
his government, with the English, and to re-establish the peace
which had been disturbed by the foolish and violent proceedings
of his predecessor Lin.&nbsp; That which most emphatically proves
the capacity of Ki-Chan is, that on his arrival at Canton he
recognised the infinite superiority of the Europeans over the
Chinese, and saw that war was impossible.&nbsp; He, accordingly,
forthwith commenced negociations with Mr. Elliott, the English
plenipotentiary, and peace was concluded, on the consideration of
the cession of the small island of Hong-Kong.&nbsp; To cement the
good understanding that had been established between the Emperor
Tao-Kouang and Queen Victoria, Ki-Chan gave the English
authorities a magnificent banquet, at which was present M. de
Rosamel, the commander of the corvette <i>Danaide</i>, which had
arrived a few days before in the roads of Macao.&nbsp; Every one
was enchanted with the graceful and affable manners of the
commissioner-general.</p>
<p>A few days only elapsed before the intrigues worked at Peking
by the former imperial commissioner, Lin, occasioned the
disallowance by the Emperor of the treaty that had just been
concluded at Canton.&nbsp; Ki-Chan was accused of having allowed
himself to be corrupted by English gold, and of having sold to
the &ldquo;sea devils&rdquo; the territory of the Celestial
Empire.&nbsp; The Emperor sent him a furious letter, declaring
him worthy of death, and ordering him to repair to Peking
forthwith.&nbsp; The poor imperial commissioner had not his head
cut off, as every one expected.&nbsp; The Emperor, in his
paternal mildness, gave him his life, and merely degraded him
from all his titles, withdrew all his decorations, confiscated
his property, razed his house, sold his wives by public auction,
and banished him to the depths of Tartary.&nbsp; The numerous and
influential friends whom Ki-Chan had at court, did not desert him
in his reverses; they laboured with courage and perseverance to
reinstate him in the good graces of the Emperor.&nbsp; In 1841,
he was, at length, recalled, and sent to Lha-Ssa as
envoy-extraordinary in the matter of the Nomekhan.&nbsp; He
departed, decorated with the blue button, <!-- page 163--><a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>instead of
the red one, which he wore before his fall; they restored to him
the peacock&rsquo;s feather, but the privilege of wearing the
yellow tunic was still withheld.&nbsp; His friends at Peking
clubbed together and built for him a magnificent house.&nbsp; The
post of Kin-Tchai, amid the mountains of Thibet, was still
considered banishment; but it was a step towards a glorious and
complete reinstatement.&nbsp; Immediately upon his arrival at
Lha-Ssa, Ki-Chan concerted with the Bandchan-Remboutchi, and had
the Nomekhan arrested.&nbsp; He then proceeded to examine all the
persons attached to the service of the accused, and, in order to
facilitate their declaration of the truth, he had long bamboo
needles thrust under their nails; by this means, as the Chinese
phrase it, &ldquo;truth was separated from falsehood,&rdquo; and
the conduct of the Nomekhan was brought to light.&nbsp; The
wretched man avowed his crimes voluntarily, in order to avoid the
torture.&nbsp; He acknowledged himself guilty of taking away
three lives from the Tal&eacute;-Lama; of having used violent
means to make him transmigrate, the first time by strangulation,
the second time by suffocation, and the third by poison.&nbsp; A
confession was drawn up in the Tartar, Chinese, and Thibetian
languages; the Nomekhan and his accomplices signed it; the
Bandchan-Remboutchi, the four Kalons, and the Chinese ambassador
set their seals to it; and it was immediately forwarded to Peking
by a courier-extraordinary.&nbsp; All this was done in
secret.&nbsp; Three months afterwards, the capital of Thibet was
thrown into a state of the greatest agitation; there was seen
placarded on the great gate of the Nomekhan&rsquo;s palace, and
in the principal streets of the town, an imperial edict, in three
languages, on yellow paper, and with borders representing winged
dragons.&nbsp; After a long flourish about the duties of kings,
and of sovereigns, great and small, and an exhortation to the
potentates, monarchs, princes, magistrates, and people of the
four seas, to walk in the paths of justice and virtue, under pain
of incurring the wrath of heaven and the indignation of the Grand
Khan, the Emperor recounted the crimes of the Nomekhan, and
condemned him to perpetual banishment on the banks of the
Sakhalien-Oula, in the depths of Mantchouria.&nbsp; At the end
was the usual formula: &ldquo;Tremble and obey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The inhabitants of Lha-Ssa collected round these strange
placards, which they were unused to see on the walls of their
town.&nbsp; The report of the condemnation of the Nomekhan spread
rapidly among the people.&nbsp; Numerous groups began to form,
who discussed the point with vehemence, but in whispers.&nbsp;
All faces were animated, and from every quarter there rose a deep
murmur.&nbsp; This agitation among the Thibetian people arose not
so much from the merited downfall of the Nomekhan, as from the
interference of <!-- page 164--><a name="page164"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 164</span>the Chinese authorities, an
interference which every one felt to be very humiliating.</p>
<p>At the Lamasery of Sera, opposition manifested itself with an
altogether different sort of energy.&nbsp; As soon as they had
notice there of the imperial edict, the insurrection was
spontaneous and general.&nbsp; Those 15,000 Lamas, who were all
devoted to the cause of the Nomekhan, armed themselves hastily
with lances, fusils, sticks, whatever came first to hand, and
threw themselves into Lha-Ssa, which was only half a league
distant.&nbsp; The thick clouds of dust which they raised in
their disorderly course, and the terrible shouts they sent forth,
announced their arrival to the inhabitants of
Lha-Ssa&mdash;&ldquo;The Lamas of Sera!&nbsp; Here are the Lamas
of Sera!&rdquo;&nbsp; Such was the cry which resounded through
the town, and inspired all hearts with fear.&nbsp; The Lamas
burst like an avalanche upon the house of the Chinese ambassador,
and dashed in the door with shouts of &ldquo;Death to Ki-Chan!
death to the Chinese!&rdquo;&nbsp; But they found no one upon
whom they could vent their rage.&nbsp; The ambassador, forewarned
in time of their arrival, had run and concealed himself in the
house of a Kalon, and the people of his train were dispersed over
the town.&nbsp; The multitude of Lamas then divided itself into
several bands, some took their way to the palace of the Nomekhan,
and others besieged the dwellings of the Kalons, demanding loudly
that they should give up to them the Chinese ambassador.&nbsp;
There was, on this point, a long and fierce contest, in which one
of the four Thibetian ministers was torn to pieces, and the
others received wounds more or less dangerous.</p>
<p>Whilst they were contending with the Kalons for possession of
the person of Ki-Chan, the most numerous party of the Lamas had
broken into the prison where the Nomekhan was confined, and
wanted to bear him in triumph to the Lamasery of Sera.&nbsp; The
Nomekhan, however, strongly opposed this intention, and exerted
all his influence to calm the excitement of the Lamas.&nbsp; He
told them that their inconsiderate revolt aggravated his position
instead of ameliorating it.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;the victim of a conspiracy.&nbsp; I will go to Peking; I
will explain the whole affair to the Emperor, and will return in
triumph amongst you.&nbsp; At present we have only to obey the
imperial decree.&nbsp; I will depart, as I have been
commanded.&nbsp; Do you go back quietly to your
Lamasery.&rdquo;&nbsp; These words did not shake the resolution
of the Lamas, but, night falling, they returned tumultuously to
Sera, promising themselves a better plan for the morrow.&nbsp;
When day broke, the Lamas began to move about in their vast
monastery, and to prepare themselves for a fresh invasion of the
town of Lha-Ssa, but, to their great astonishment, they perceived
in the plain, round about the Lamasery, <!-- page 165--><a
name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>numerous
tents and a multitude of Chinese and Thibetian soldiers, armed to
the teeth, and prepared to bar their passage.&nbsp; At this
sight, all their valour evaporated: the marine conch was sounded,
and these extempore soldiers, throwing aside their arms,
re-entered their cells, took their books under their arms, and
quietly proceeded to the choir, to recite, as usual, their
matins.</p>
<p>A few days afterwards, the Nomekhan, accompanied by a strong
escort, took the road to Sse-Tchouen, and proceeded like a sheep,
to the place of exile that had been assigned him.&nbsp; They
could never understand at Lha-Ssa how the man, who had not
hesitated to murder three Tal&eacute;-Lamas, had not chosen to
take advantage of the insurrection of the Lamas of Sera.&nbsp;
Certain it is, that, with a single word, he might have
annihilated all the Chinese at Lha-Ssa, and most probably set all
Thibet in a blaze; but the Nomekhan was not formed to play such a
part; he had the cowardly energy of an assassin, but not the
audacity of a revolutionist.</p>
<p>Ki-Chan, encouraged by his triumph, wanted to extend his power
to the Thibetian accomplices of the Nomekhan.&nbsp; This claim,
however, did not suit the Kalons, who told him that to them alone
belonged the right of judging men who in no wise were subject to
China, and against whom they had not asked for the protection of
the Emperor.&nbsp; The Kin-Tchai did not press the point; but,
not to appear to yield to the Thibetian authorities, he replied
to them officially, &ldquo;that he left to them these inferior
assassins, who were below the notice of the representative of the
Emperor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A new Nomekhan was elected in the place of the exile.&nbsp;
The person selected for this important charge was the Chaberon of
the Lamasery of Ran-Tchan, a young man of eighteen years of
age.&nbsp; The Tal&eacute;-Lama and the new Nomekhan being
minors, at the time that we arrived at Lha-Ssa, the regency was
entrusted to the first Kalon.&nbsp; All the solicitude of the
Regent was applied to the erection of barriers against the
encroachments and usurpation of the Chinese ambassador, who
sought, by all possible means, to avail himself of the present
feebleness of the Thibetian government.</p>

<p>As soon as we had presented ourselves to the Thibetian
authorities, declaring our characters and the object which had
brought us to Lha-Ssa, we availed ourselves of the semi-official
position we had <!-- page 167--><a name="page167"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 167</span>thus taken, to enter into
communication with the Thibetian and Tartar Lamas, and thus, at
last, to begin our work as missionaries.&nbsp; One day, when we
were sitting beside our modest hearth, talking of religious
questions with a Lama who was well versed in Buddhist learning, a
Chinese dressed in exquisite style suddenly appeared before us,
saying that he was a merchant and very desirous of buying our
goods.&nbsp; We told him we had nothing to sell.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How, nothing to sell?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Not anything,
except indeed those two old saddles, which we do not want any
longer.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, exactly; that is just what I am
looking for; I want saddles.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, while he examined
our poor merchandise, he addressed to us a thousand questions
about our country and the places we had visited before we came to
Lha-Ssa.&nbsp; Shortly afterwards there arrives a second Chinese,
then a third, and at last two Lamas, in costly silk
scarves.&nbsp; All these visitors insisted upon buying something
from us; they overwhelmed us with questions, and seemed, at the
same time, to scrutinise with distrust all the corners of our
chamber.</p>
<p>We might say, as often as we liked, that we were not
merchants&mdash;they insisted.&nbsp; In default of silk, drapery,
or hardware, they would like our saddles; they turned them round
and round in every way, finding them now perfectly magnificent,
now abominable.&nbsp; At last, after long haggling and
cross-questioning, they went off, promising to return.</p>
<p>The visit of these five individuals occasioned much serious
reflection; their manner of acting and speaking was not at all
natural.&nbsp; Although they came one after the other, yet they
seemed perfectly to understand each other, and to aim at the same
end by the same means.&nbsp; Their desire of buying something
from us was evidently a mere pretext for disguising their
intentions: these people were rather swindlers or spies, than
real merchants.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; we said, &ldquo;let us
wait quietly; sooner or later we shall see clearly into this
affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As it was dinner time, we sat down to table, or rather, we
remained at the fireside, contemplating the pot, in which a good
cut of beef had been boiling for some hours.&nbsp; Samdadchiemba,
in his quality of steward, brought this to the surface of the
liquid by means of a large wooden spoon, seized it with his
nails, and threw it on the end of a board, where he cut it into
three equal pieces; each then took his portion in his cup, and
with the aid of a few rolls baked in the ashes, we tranquilly
commenced our dinner without troubling ourselves very much about
swindlers or spies.&nbsp; We were at our dessert&mdash;that is to
say, we were about to rinse our cups with some buttered tea, when
the two Lamas, the pretended merchants, made their
re-appearance.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Regent,&rdquo; they said, <!--
page 168--><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>&ldquo;awaits you in his palace; he wants to speak to
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But,&rdquo; cried we, &ldquo;does the
Regent, perchance, also want to buy our old saddles?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is not a question about either saddles or
merchandise.&nbsp; Rise at once, and follow us to the
Regent.&rdquo;&nbsp; The matter was now beyond a doubt; the
government was desirous of meddling with us&mdash;to what
end?&nbsp; Was it to do us good or ill, to give us liberty, or to
shackle us? to let us live or to make us die?&nbsp; This we could
not tell.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us go to the Regent,&rdquo; we said,
&ldquo;and trust for the rest to the will of our heavenly
Father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After having dressed ourselves in our best, and put on our
majestic caps of fox-skin, we said to our apparitor, &ldquo;We
are ready.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And this young man,&rdquo; he
said, pointing to Samdadchiemba, who had turned his eyes upon him
with no very affectionate expression.&nbsp; &ldquo;This young
man, he is our servant, he will take care of the house in our
absence.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, no, he must come too; the Regent
wishes to see all three of you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Samdadchiemba shook,
by way of making his toilet, his great robe of sheepskin, placed,
in a very insolent manner, a small black cap over his ear, and we
departed all together, after padlocking the door of our
lodging.</p>
<p>We went at a rapid pace for about five or six minutes, and
then arrived at the palace of the First Kalon, the Regent of
Thibet.&nbsp; After having crossed a large courtyard, where were
assembled a great number of Lamas and Chinese, who began to
whisper when they saw us appear, we were stopped before a gilt
door, the folds of which stood ajar; our leader passed through a
small corridor on the left, and an instant after the door was
opened.&nbsp; At the farther end of an apartment, simply
furnished, we perceived a personage sitting with crossed legs on
a thick cushion covered with a tiger&rsquo;s-skin: it was the
Regent.&nbsp; With his right hand he made us a sign to
approach.&nbsp; We went close up to him, and saluted him by
placing our caps under our arms.&nbsp; A bench covered with a red
carpet stood on our right; on this we were invited to sit
down&mdash;we complied immediately.&nbsp; Meantime the gilt door
was closed, and there remained in the saloon only the Regent and
seven individuals, who stood behind him&mdash;namely, four Lamas
of a modest and composed bearing, two sly-looking,
mischievous-eyed Chinese, and a person whom, by his long beard,
his turban, and grave countenance, we recognised to be a
Mussulman.&nbsp; The Regent was a man of fifty years of age; his
large features, mild and remarkably pallid, breathed a truly
royal majesty; his dark eyes, shaded by long lashes, were
intelligent and gentle.&nbsp; He was dressed in a yellow robe,
edged with sable; a ring, adorned with diamonds, hung from his
left ear, and his long, jet black hair was collected together at
the top of his head, and fastened by three small gold
combs.&nbsp; His large <!-- page 169--><a
name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>red cap,
set with pearls and surmounted by a coral ball, lay at his side
on a green cushion.</p>
<p>When we were seated, the Regent gazed at us for a long while
in silence, and with a minute attention.&nbsp; He turned his head
alternately to the right and left, and smiled at us in a half
mocking, half friendly manner.&nbsp; This sort of pantomime
appeared to us at last so droll, that we could not help
laughing.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; we said in French, and in an
undertone, &ldquo;this gentleman seems a good fellow enough; our
affair will go on very well.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said
the Regent, in a very affable tone, &ldquo;what language is that
you speak?&nbsp; I did not understand what you said?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;We spoke the language of our country.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, repeat aloud what you said just now.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;We said, &lsquo;This gentleman seems a good-natured fellow
enough.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; The Regent, turning to those who were
standing behind him, said, &ldquo;Do you understand this
language?&rdquo;&nbsp; They all bowed together, and answered that
they did not understand it.&nbsp; &ldquo;You see, nobody here
understands the language of your country.&nbsp; Translate your
words into the Thibetian.&rdquo;&nbsp; We said, that in the
physiognomy of the First Kalon there was expressed much
kindliness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah! you think I have much kindliness;
yet I am very ill-natured.&nbsp; Is it not true that I am very
ill-natured?&rdquo; he asked his attendants.&nbsp; They answered
merely by smiling.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; continued
the Regent; &ldquo;I am kind, for kindness is the duty of a
Kalon.&nbsp; I must be kind towards my people, and also towards
strangers.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then addressed to us a long harangue,
of which we could comprehend only a few sentences.&nbsp; When he
had finished, we told him that, not being much accustomed to the
Thibetian language, we had not fully penetrated the sense of his
words.&nbsp; The Regent signed to a Chinese, who, stepping
forward, translated to us his harangue, of which the following is
the outline.&nbsp; We had been summoned without the slightest
idea of being molested.&nbsp; The contradictory reports that had
circulated respecting us since our arrival at Lha-Ssa, had
induced the Regent to question us himself, in order to know where
we came from.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are from the western sky,&rdquo; we
said to the Regent.&nbsp; &ldquo;From Calcutta?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;No; our country is called France.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You
are, doubtless, Peling?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, we are
Frenchmen.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Can you write?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Better than speak.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Regent, turning round,
addressed some words to a Lama, who disappearing, returned in a
moment with paper, ink, and a bamboo point.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here is
paper,&rdquo; said the Regent; &ldquo;write
something.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;In what language&mdash;in
Thibetian?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, write some letters in your own
country&rsquo;s language.&rdquo;&nbsp; One of us took the paper
on his knees, and wrote this sentence: &ldquo;What avails it to
man to conquer the whole world, if he lose his soul?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ah, here are characters <!-- page 170--><a
name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>of your
country!&nbsp; I never saw any like them; and what is the meaning
of that?&rdquo;&nbsp; We wrote the translation in Thibetian,
Tartar, and Chinese, and handed it to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have
not been deceived,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you are men of great
knowledge.&nbsp; You can write in all languages, and you express
thoughts as profound as those we find in the
prayer-books.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then repeated, slowly moving his
head to and fro, &ldquo;What avails it to man to conquer the
whole world if he lose his own soul?&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the Regent and his attendants were indulging in their
raptures at our wonderful knowledge, we heard on a sudden, in the
courtyard of the palace, the cries of the crowd and the sonorous
noise of the Chinese tamtam.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here is the ambassador
of Peking,&rdquo; said the Regent, &ldquo;he wishes to examine
you himself.&nbsp; Tell him frankly what concerns you, and rely
on my protection; it is I who govern the country.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This said, he quitted the saloon with his retinue through a small
secret door, and left us alone in this judgment-hall.</p>
<p>The idea of falling into the hands of the Chinese made at
first a disagreeable impression upon us; and the picture of those
horrible persecutions which at different times have afflicted the
christendoms of China, seized upon our imagination; but we soon
recovered our spirits in the reflection that we were alone, and
isolated as we were in the midst of Thibet, could not compromise
any one.&nbsp; This thought gave us courage.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Samdadchiemba,&rdquo; we said to our young neophyte,
&ldquo;now must we show that we are brave men, that we are
Christians.&nbsp; This affair will perhaps proceed to great
lengths; but let us never lose sight of eternity.&nbsp; If we are
treated well, we shall thank God for it; if we are maltreated, we
shall thank him nevertheless, for we shall have the happiness of
suffering for the faith.&nbsp; If we are killed, the martyrdom
will be a splendid crowning of all our labours.&nbsp; To arrive,
after a journey of only eighteen months, in heaven, were not that
a good journey? were not that happiness?&nbsp; What do you say,
Samdadchiemba?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I have never been in fear of
death; if I am asked whether I am a Christian, you will see if I
tremble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This excellent frame of mind in Samdadchiemba filled our
hearts with joy, and completely dissipated the unpleasant
impressions which this misadventure had occasioned.&nbsp; We
thought for a moment of considering the questions that would
probably be put to us, and the answers we should give; but we
rejected this counsel of mere human prudence, reflecting that the
moment had come for us to keep strictly to the injunction which
our Saviour addressed to his disciples, that &ldquo;when they
were brought before the synagogues, governors, and kings, they
should take no thought how or <!-- page 171--><a
name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>what they
should speak;&rdquo; only it was agreed that we should salute the
Mandarin in the French way, and that we should not kneel before
him.&nbsp; We thought that, having the honour to be Christians,
missionaries, and Frenchmen, we might very fairly insist on
standing erect before any Chinese whatsoever.</p>
<p>After waiting a few moments, a young Chinese, elegantly
dressed, and of very graceful manners, came to inform us that
Ki-Chan, grand ambassador of the grand Emperor of China, wished
to examine us.&nbsp; We followed our amiable apparitor, and were
ushered into a saloon decorated in the Chinese style, where
Ki-Chan was seated upon a sort of throne, about three feet high,
and covered with red cloth.&nbsp; Before him was a small table of
black laque, upon which were an inkstand, some pens, some sheets
of paper, and a silver vase filled with snuff.&nbsp; Below the
throne were four scribes, two on the right, and two on the left;
the rest of the saloon was occupied by a great number of Chinese
and Thibetians, who had put on their holiday dresses to attend
the inquiry.</p>
<p>Ki-Chan, although sixty years old, seemed to us full of
strength and vigour.&nbsp; His face is, without contradiction,
the most noble, elegant, and intellectual we have seen amongst
the Chinese.&nbsp; When we took off our caps to him, and made him
one of our best bows, &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis well, &rsquo;tis
well,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;follow your own customs.&nbsp; I
have been told you speak correctly the language of Peking.&nbsp;
I want to talk with you for a moment.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We make
many blunders in speaking, but your marvellous understanding will
know how to remedy the obscurity of our words.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why, that is pure Pekinese.&nbsp; You Frenchmen possess a
great facility for all learning.&nbsp; You are Frenchmen, are you
not?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, we are Frenchmen.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, I know the French; there were formerly a great many of
them at Peking; I used to see some of them.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;You must have known them, too, at Canton, when you were
imperial commissioner?&rdquo;&nbsp; This reminiscence furrowed
the forehead of our judge; he took an abundant pinch of snuff out
of his box, and threw it up his nose in a very bad humour.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, that is true; I have seen many Europeans at
Canton.&nbsp; You are of the religion of the Lord of Heaven, are
you not?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Certainly we are; moreover,
preachers of that religion.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I know, I know;
you have come hither, doubtless, to preach that
religion?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We have no other
object.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you already travelled over a
great number of countries?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We have travelled
over all China, Tartary, and now we are in the capital of
Thibet.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;With whom did you live when you were
in China?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We do not answer questions of that
sort.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And if I command you to do
so?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We should not obey.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here the
irritated judge struck the table with his fist.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
know,&rdquo; we <!-- page 172--><a name="page172"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 172</span>said, &ldquo;that Christians have no
fear; why seek, then, to intimidate us?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Where
did you learn Chinese?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;In China.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;In what place?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;A little
everywhere.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And the Tartar, you know it?
where did you learn it?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;In Mongolia, in the
Land of Grass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After some other trifling questions, Ki-Chan, telling us that
we must be tired, invited us to seat ourselves.&nbsp; Then
suddenly changing his tone and manner, he addressed
Samdadchiemba, who, with his hand on his hip, had been standing a
little behind us.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you,&rdquo; he said, in a dry
and angry voice, &ldquo;whence are you?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am
from Ki-Tou-Sse.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What is Ki-Tou-Sse? who
knows that?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ki-Tou-Sse is in
San-Tchouen.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, you are from San-Tchouen, in
the province of Kan-Sou.&nbsp; Son of the central nation, on your
knees!&rdquo;&nbsp; Samdadchiemba turned pale, his hand left his
hip, and his arm modestly glided down along his leg.&nbsp;
&ldquo;On your knees,&rdquo; repeated the Mandarin, in a
thundering voice.&nbsp; Samdadchiemba fell on his knees, saying,
&ldquo;On my knees, standing or sitting, &rsquo;tis all the same
to me: a man of labour and fatigue, as I am, is not accustomed to
take his ease.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, you are from
Kan-Sou,&rdquo; said the judge, taking large pinches of snuff;
&ldquo;ah! you are from Kan-Sou; you are a child of the central
nation!&nbsp; Very well; in that case, it is within my province
to deal with you.&nbsp; Son of the central nation, answer your
father and mother, and take heed how you tell lies.&nbsp; Where
did you meet with these two foreigners?&nbsp; How did you become
attached to their service?&rdquo;&nbsp; Samdadchiemba gave, with
perfect self-confidence, a long history of his life, which seemed
to interest the auditory; he then related how he had made our
acquaintance in Tartary, and the reasons that had induced him to
follow us.&nbsp; Our young neophyte spoke with dignity, and,
moreover, with a prudence which we had not expected.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why did you adopt the religion of the Lord of
Heaven?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you know that this is forbidden by the
grand Emperor?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The <i>entirely humble</i> <a
name="citation172"></a><a href="#footnote172"
class="citation">[172]</a> adopted that religion, because it is
the only true religion.&nbsp; How could I suppose that the grand
Emperor proscribed a religion which orders man to do good and to
avoid evil?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That is true, the religion of the
Lord of Heaven is holy; I know it.&nbsp; Why did you enter the
service of these foreigners?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you know that the
laws forbid that?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How should an ignorant man,
as I am, know who is a foreigner, and who not?&nbsp; These men
always showed kindness to me, always exhorted me to practise
virtue; why was I not to follow them?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How
much wages do <!-- page 173--><a name="page173"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 173</span>they pay you?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;If
I accompany them, it is to save my soul, and not to get
money.&nbsp; My masters have never let me want rice and clothes,
and with that I am satisfied.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you
married?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;As I was a Lama, before entering the
religion of the Lord of Heaven, I have never been
married.&rdquo;&nbsp; The judge then laughingly addressed an
indelicate question to Samdadchiemba, who lowered his eyes and
remained silent.&nbsp; One of us rising, said to Ki-Chan:
&ldquo;Our religion not only prohibits the commission of impure
actions, but also the thinking or speaking of them; it is even
not permitted to us to listen to indecent
expressions.&rdquo;&nbsp; These words pronounced with calmness
and solemnity, raised a slight blush on the face of his
excellency the ambassador of China.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;I know the religion of the Lord of Heaven is
holy; I know it, for I have read its books of doctrine; he who
should strictly keep all its precepts would be a man without
reproach.&rdquo;&nbsp; He made a sign to Samdadchiemba to rise;
then, turning to us, he said: &ldquo;It is night, you must be
tired; it is time to take supper; you may go; to-morrow, if I
want you, I will send for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ambassador Ki-Chan was quite right, it was very late, and
the various emotions which had been furnished to us in the course
of the evening had not by any means supplied the place of
supper.&nbsp; On leaving the Sinico-Thibetian pretorium, we were
accosted by a venerable Lama, who informed us that the First
Kalon awaited us.&nbsp; We crossed the court, illuminated by some
red lanterns; turned on the right, to a perilous staircase, which
we ascended, prudently holding on by our conductor&rsquo;s robe;
then, after traversing a long terrace, in the dubious light of
the stars, we were introduced to the Regent.&nbsp; The large and
lofty room was splendidly lighted by butter-oil lamps, the walls,
the ceiling, even the floor, were all covered with gilding and
brilliant colours.&nbsp; The Regent was alone; he bade us sit
down near himself on a rich carpet, and endeavoured to express by
his words, and still more by his gestures, how deep an interest
he felt in us.&nbsp; Above all, we clearly understood that he was
making arrangements to keep us from starving.&nbsp; Our pantomime
was interrupted by the arrival of a person, who left, upon
entering, his slippers at the door; it was the governor of the
Cashmerian Mussulmen.&nbsp; After having saluted the company, by
raising his hand to his forehead, and pronouncing the formula,
&ldquo;Salamalek&rdquo; he leant against a column, in the centre
of the room, which supported the ceiling.&nbsp; The Mussulmen
governor spoke Chinese very well; and the Regent had accordingly
sent for him to act as interpreter.&nbsp; Immediately upon his
arrival, a servant placed before us a small table, and supper was
served up to us at the expense of the Thibetian government.&nbsp;
We shall not say anything here as to <!-- page 174--><a
name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>the
Regent&rsquo;s <i>cuisine</i>; firstly, because our keen appetite
did not permit us to pay sufficient attention to the quality of
the dishes; secondly, because that day our minds were more
occupied with politics than with gastronomy.&nbsp; All of a
sudden we missed Samdadchiemba; we asked what had become of him:
&ldquo;He is with my servants,&rdquo; answered the Regent;
&ldquo;do not trouble yourselves on his account, he shall not
want for anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During, and after the repast, there was much inquiry about
France and the countries we had visited.&nbsp; Then the Regent,
pointing to the pictures that adorned his room, asked whether we
could ourselves paint any such.&nbsp; &ldquo;We cannot
paint,&rdquo; was our answer; &ldquo;study, and the preaching of
the doctrine of Jehovah are our only occupations.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t tell me you cannot paint; I know that the
people of your country are very skilful in that art.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, those who make it their employment; but our clergymen
are not in the habit of exercising it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Though
you may not follow this art specially, yet you are not quite
unacquainted with it; you can, doubtless, draw geographical
maps?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, we cannot.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How!
on your journey did you never sketch, did you never make a
map?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Never.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, that is
impossible!&rdquo;&nbsp; The pertinacity of the Regent in
questioning us on this subject, made us pause to reflect;
presently we expressed the surprise we felt at all these
inquiries.&nbsp; &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you
are straightforward, honest men; I will speak frankly to
you.&nbsp; The Chinese are very suspicious, you are aware of
that: you have been long enough in China to know it as well as I
do; well, they believe that you are travelling through foreign
kingdoms, on purpose to draw maps of them and to explore
them.&nbsp; If you do draw, if you do make geographical maps,
admit it without fear; rely on my protection.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Evidently the Regent was afraid of an invasion; he fancied,
perhaps, that we were charged with laying down the route for some
formidable army, ready to overwhelm Thibet.&nbsp; We endeavoured
to dissipate his fears, and to assure him of the extremely
peaceful views of the French government.&nbsp; We admitted,
however, that amongst our effects there was a great number of
drawings and geographical maps, and that we had even a map of
Thibet.&nbsp; At these words, the face of the Regent was suddenly
contracted; but we hastened to add, in order to quiet him, that
all our drawings and maps were printed, and that we were not
their authors.&nbsp; We took the opportunity to speak to the
Regent and the Cashmerian governor, of the geographical knowledge
of the Europeans.&nbsp; They were greatly astonished when we told
them that, with us, children of ten and twelve years old
possessed an exact and complete idea of all the kingdoms of the
world.</p>
<p><!-- page 175--><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span>The conversation extended far into the night.&nbsp; At
last the Regent rose, and asked us whether we did not feel in
want of a little repose.&nbsp; &ldquo;We only awaited,&rdquo; we
answered, &ldquo;for the permission of the Kalon, to return to
our lodgings.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Your lodgings!&nbsp; I have
ordered an apartment to be prepared for you in my palace; you
will sleep here to-night: to-morrow, you can return to your
house.&rdquo;&nbsp; We sought to excuse ourselves from accepting
the kind offer of the Regent; but soon became aware that we were
not at liberty to refuse what we had been simple enough to
consider a compliment.&nbsp; We were regular prisoners.&nbsp; We
took leave of the Regent rather coolly, and followed an
individual, who, after crossing a great many rooms and corridors,
ushered us into a sort of closet, which we might fairly call a
prison, as we were not permitted to leave it for any other
place.</p>
<p>There had been prepared for us two couches, which, no doubt,
were infinitely superior to our own beds; nevertheless, we
regretted our poor pallets, whereon we had so long enjoyed a free
and independent sleep throughout our travels in the desert.&nbsp;
Lamas and attendants of the Regent came in great numbers to see
us.&nbsp; Those who had gone to bed got up, and soon we heard, in
this vast palace, lately so calm and silent, doors opened and
shut, and the rapid steps of the curious sounding in the
passages.&nbsp; Crowds thronged around us and examined us with
insupportable avidity.&nbsp; In all those eyes staring at us
there was neither sympathy nor ill-will; they simply expressed
vapid curiosity.&nbsp; To all these individuals around us, we
represented merely a kind of zoological phenomenon.&nbsp; Oh, how
hard it is to be exposed thus to an indifferent multitude!&nbsp;
When we thought that these troublesome people had sufficiently
stared and whispered, and ought now to be satisfied, we informed
them that we were going to bed, and that we should feel extremely
obliged if they would be kind enough to retire.&nbsp; Everyone
bowed: some of them even were polite enough to put out their
tongues at us; but nobody stirred.&nbsp; It was evident that they
had a mind to know how we should behave on going to bed.&nbsp;
This desire seemed to us somewhat misplaced; but we thought we
would submit to it up to a certain point.&nbsp; Accordingly we
knelt down, made the sign of the cross, and recited, aloud, our
evening prayer.&nbsp; As soon as we commenced, the whispering
ceased, and a religious silence prevailed.&nbsp; When the prayer
was finished, we once more invited the crowd to leave us, and, in
order to add efficacy to our words, we extinguished the
light.&nbsp; The crowd, thus plunged into deep darkness, adopted
the course of first having a hearty laugh, and then retiring
gropingly.&nbsp; We closed the door of our prison and laid down
to rest.</p>
<p><!-- page 176--><a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
176</span>When stretched on the beds of the First Kalon, we felt
much more disposed to talk than to sleep.&nbsp; We experienced a
certain pleasure in recapitulating the adventures of the
day.&nbsp; The feigned merchants who wanted to purchase our
saddles, our appearance before the Regent, the examination we had
undergone by the ambassador, Ki-Chan, our supper at the expense
of the public treasury, our long conversation with the Regent:
all this appeared to us a phantasmagoria.&nbsp; It seemed as
though our whole day had been a long nightmare.&nbsp; Our journey
itself, our arrival at Lha-Ssa, everything seemed
incredible.&nbsp; We asked one another whether it was true, that
we, missionaries, Frenchmen, were really in the states of the
Tal&eacute;-Lama, in the capital of Thibet, sleeping in the very
palace of the Regent.&nbsp; All these events, past and present,
clashed in our heads.&nbsp; The future, especially, appeared to
us enveloped in dark, thick clouds.&nbsp; How was all this to
end?&nbsp; Would they say to us, &ldquo;You are free; go wherever
you please?&rdquo;&nbsp; Would they keep us in this prison? or
would they strangle us?&nbsp; These reflections were well
calculated to chill the heart, and to cause a head-ache.&nbsp;
But trust in God is a grand thing in such trials!&nbsp; How happy
is one in feeling one&rsquo;s-self supported by Providence, when
one is thus left alone, abandoned, and destitute of
succour.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said we to each other,
&ldquo;let us be prepared for the worst, relying upon the
protection of our Heavenly Father!&nbsp; Not a single hair will
fall from our heads without his permission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We went to sleep amid these considerations, but our slumber
was light and disturbed.&nbsp; As soon as dawn appeared, the door
of our cell was gently opened, and the governor of the Katchi
entered.&nbsp; He took a seat at our side, between the two
couches, and asked us in kind, affectionate tones, whether we had
spent a good night.&nbsp; He then presented to us a basket of
cakes, made by his family, and some dried fruits from
Ladak.&nbsp; We were deeply touched by this attention, which
seemed to announce that we had met with a sincere and devoted
friend.</p>
<p>The governor of the Katchi was thirty-two years old; his face
full of nobleness and majesty, breathed at the same time, a
kindness and candour well calculated to arouse our
confidence.&nbsp; His looks, his words, his deportment,
everything about him, seemed to express that he felt a very
lively interest in us.&nbsp; He had come to acquaint us with what
would be done during the day, with reference to us.&nbsp;
&ldquo;In the morning,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the Thibetian
authorities will go with you to your lodgings.&nbsp; They will
put a seal upon all your effects, which will then be brought
before the tribunal, and be examined by the Regent and the
Chinese ambassador, in your presence.&nbsp; If you have no
manuscript maps in your baggage you <!-- page 177--><a
name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>need fear
nothing; you will not be molested in any way.&nbsp; If, on the
contrary, you have any such maps, you would do well to let me
know beforehand, as in this case, we may perhaps find some way to
arrange the affair.&nbsp; I am very intimate with the Regent,
(this we had, indeed, observed the night before during our
supper); and it is he himself who directed me to make to you this
confidential communication.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then added, in an
under voice, that all these 
<a href="images/p177.jpg">
<img class='clearcenter' alt=
"The Governor of Katchi"
title=
"The Governor of Katchi"
src="images/p177.jpg" />
</a> difficulties were got up against us by the Chinese, against
the will of the Thibetian government.&nbsp; We answered the
governor of Katchi, that we had not a single manuscript map; and
we then gave him, in detail, a statement of all the articles that
were in our trunks.&nbsp; &ldquo;Since they are to be examined
to-day, you will judge for yourself whether we are people to be
believed.&rdquo;&nbsp; The countenance of the Mussulman
brightened.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your words,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;quite
reassure me.&nbsp; None of the articles you have described can at
all compromise <!-- page 178--><a name="page178"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 178</span>you.&nbsp; Maps are feared in this
country&mdash;extremely feared, indeed; especially since the
affair of a certain Englishman named Moorcroft, who introduced
himself into Lha-Ssa, under the pretence of being a
Cashmerian.&nbsp; After a sojourn there of twelve years, he
departed; but he was murdered on his way to Ladak.&nbsp; Amongst
his effects they found a numerous collection of maps and plans,
which he had drawn during his stay at Lha-Ssa.&nbsp; This
circumstance has made the Chinese authorities very suspicious on
this subject.&nbsp; As you do not draw maps, that is all right; I
will now go and tell the Regent what I have heard from
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the governor of Katchi had left us, we rose, for we had
remained in bed, without ceremony, during his long visit.&nbsp;
After having offered up our morning prayer, and prepared our
hearts to patience and resignation, we ate the breakfast which
had been sent to us by order of the Regent.&nbsp; It consisted of
a plate of rolls stuffed with sugar and minced meat, and a pot of
richly-buttered tea.&nbsp; But we gave the preference to the
cakes and dried fruit, which the governor of Katchi had presented
to us.</p>
<p>Three Lama ushers soon came and announced to us the order of
the day; viz., that our luggage was to be inspected.&nbsp; We
submitted respectfully to the orders of the Thibetian authority,
and proceeded to our lodgings, accompanied by a numerous escort
all the way.&nbsp; From the palace of the Regent to our
habitation we observed great excitement; they were sweeping the
streets, removing the dirt, and decorating the fronts of the
houses with large strips of poulou, yellow and red.&nbsp; We
asked ourselves what all this meant? for whom were all these
demonstrations of honour and respect?&nbsp; Suddenly we heard
behind us loud acclamations, and turning round we saw the Regent,
who was advancing, mounted on a magnificent white charger, and
surrounded by numerous horsemen.&nbsp; We arrived at our lodgings
nearly at the same time with him.&nbsp; We opened the padlock by
which the door was fastened, and requested the Regent to honour
us by entering the apartments of the French missionaries.</p>
<p>Samdadchiemba, whom we had not seen since our audience with
the Chinese ambassador, was there too.&nbsp; He was quite
stupified, for he could not comprehend these proceedings.&nbsp;
The servants of the Regent, with whom he had passed the night,
could not give him any information.&nbsp; We said to him some
words of encouragement, giving him to understand that we were not
yet quite on the eve of martyrdom.</p>
<p>The Regent took a seat in the middle of our room on a gilded
chair, which had been brought from the palace for this purpose,
and asked whether what he saw in our room was all we
possessed?&nbsp; <!-- page 179--><a name="page179"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 179</span>&ldquo;Yes; that is all we possess;
neither more nor less.&nbsp; These are all our resources for
invading Thibet.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;There is satire in your
words,&rdquo; said the Regent; &ldquo;I never fancied you such
dangerous people.&nbsp; What is that?&rdquo; he added, pointing
to a crucifix we had fixed against the wall.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, if
you really knew what that was, you would not say that we were not
formidable; for by that we design to conquer China, Tartary, and
Thibet.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Regent laughed, for he only saw a joke
in our words, which yet were so real and serious.</p>
<p>A scribe sat down at the feet of the Regent, and made an
inventory of our trunks, clothes, and kitchen implements.&nbsp; A
lighted lamp was brought, and the Regent took from a small purse
which hung from his neck, a golden seal, which was applied to all
our baggage.&nbsp; Nothing was omitted; our old boots, the very
pins of our travelling tent, were all daubed with red wax, and
solemnly marked with the seal of the Tal&eacute;-Lama.</p>
<p>When this long ceremony was completed, the Regent informed us
that we must now proceed to the tribunal.&nbsp; Some porters were
sent for, and found in very brief time.&nbsp; A Lama of the
police had only to present himself in the street and summon, in
the name of the law, all the passers by, men, women, and
children, to come into the house immediately and assist the
government.&nbsp; At Lha-Ssa, the system of enforced labour is in
a most prosperous and flourishing state; the Thibetians coming
into it with entire willingness and good grace.</p>
<p>When enough labourers were collected, all our goods were
distributed among them, and the room was completely cleared, and
the procession to the tribunal set out with great pomp.&nbsp; A
Thibetian horse soldier, his drawn sword in hand, and his fusil
at his side, opened the procession; after him came the troop of
porters, marching between two lines of Lama satellites; the
Regent, on his white charger, surrounded by a mounted guard of
honour, followed our baggage; and last, behind the Regent,
marched the two poor French missionaries, who had, by way of
suite, a no very agreeable crowd of gapers.&nbsp; Our mien was
not particularly imposing.&nbsp; Led like malefactors, or, at
least, like suspected persons, we could only lower our eyes, and
modestly pass through the numerous crowd that thronged on our
way.&nbsp; Such a position was, indeed, very painful and
humiliating; but the remembrance of our holy Saviour, dragged to
the pretorium, through the streets of Jerusalem, was sufficient
to mitigate the bitterness with which we were afflicted.&nbsp; We
prayed to him to sanctify our humiliations by his own, and to
accept them in remembrance of his Passion.</p>
<p>When we arrived at the tribunal, the Chinese ambassador <!--

</a> attended by his staff, was already in his place.&nbsp; The
Regent addressed him: &ldquo;You want to examine the effects of
these strangers; here they are; examine them.&nbsp; These men are
neither rich, nor powerful, as you suppose.&rdquo;&nbsp; There
was vexation in the tone of the Regent, and, at bottom, he was
naturally enough annoyed at this part of policeman which he had
to play.&nbsp; Ki-Chan asked us if we had no more than two
trunks.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only two; everything has been brought here;
there remains in our house not a rag, not a bit of
paper.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What have you got in your two
trunks?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Here are the keys; open them, empty
them, and examine them at your pleasure.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ki-Chan
blushed, and moved back.&nbsp; His Chinese delicacy was
touched.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do these trunks belong to me?&rdquo; he
said, with emotion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have I the right to open
them?&nbsp; If anything should be missed afterwards, what would
you say?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You need not be afraid; our religion
forbids us rashly to judge our neighbour.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Open your trunks yourselves; I want to know what they <!--
page 181--><a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
181</span>contain; it is my duty to do so; but you alone have the
right to touch what belongs to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We broke the seal of the Tal&eacute;-Lama, the padlock was
removed, and these two trunks, which had been pierced by all eyes
for a long time past, were at last opened to the general
gaze.&nbsp; We took out the contents, one after another, and
displayed them on a large table.&nbsp; First came some French and
Latin volumes, then some Chinese and Tartar books, church linen,
ornaments, sacred vases, rosaries, crosses, medals, and a
magnificent collection of lithographs.&nbsp; All the spectators
were lost in contemplation at this small European museum.&nbsp;
They opened large eyes, touched each other with the elbow, and
smacked their tongues in token of admiration.&nbsp; None of them
had ever seen anything so beautiful, so rich, so
marvellous.&nbsp; Everything white they considered silver,
everything yellow, gold.&nbsp; The faces of all brightened up,
and they seemed entirely to forget that we were suspected and
dangerous people.&nbsp; The Thibetians put out their tongues and
scratched their ears at us; and the Chinese made us the most
sentimental bows.&nbsp; Our bag of medals, especially, attracted
attention, and it seemed to be anticipated that, before we left
the court, we should make a large distribution of these dazzling
gold pieces.</p>
<p>The Regent and Ki-Chan, whose minds were elevated above those
of the vulgar, and who certainly did not covet our treasure,
nevertheless forgot their character as judges.&nbsp; The sight of
our beautiful coloured pictures transported them quite out of
themselves.&nbsp; The Regent kept his hands joined, and preserved
a continuous stare with his mouth open, whilst Ki-Chan, showing
off his knowledge, explained how the French were the most
distinguished artists in the world.&nbsp; &ldquo;At one
time,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;he knew, at Peking, a French
missionary, who painted portraits that were quite alarmingly
like.&nbsp; He kept his paper concealed in the sleeve of his
robe, took the likeness as it were by stealth, and, in a whiff,
all was done.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ki-Chan asked us if we had not
watches, telescopes, magic-lanterns, etc. etc.&nbsp; We thereupon
opened a small box which no one had hitherto remarked, and which
contained a microscope.&nbsp; We adjusted its various parts, and
no one had eyes but for this singular machine, in pure gold, as
they took it to be, and which, certainly, was about to perform
wondrous things.&nbsp; Ki-Chan alone knew what a microscope
was.&nbsp; He gave an explanation of it to the public, with great
pretension and vanity.&nbsp; He then asked us to put some
animalcul&aelig; on the glass.&nbsp; We looked at his excellency
out of the corner of the eye, and then took the microscope to
pieces, joint by joint, and put it in the box.&nbsp; &ldquo;We
thought,&rdquo; said we to Ki-Chan, with a formal air, &ldquo;we
thought, that we came here to undergo <!-- page 182--><a
name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>judgment,
and not to play a comedy.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What
judgment!&rdquo; exclaimed he, abruptly; &ldquo;we wished to
examine your effects, ascertain really who you were, and that is
all.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And the maps: you do not mention
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;yes! that is the great
point; where are your maps?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Here they
are;&rdquo; and we displayed the three maps we had; a map of the
world, the two hemispheres upon the projection of Mercator, and a
Chinese empire.</p>
<p>The appearance of these maps seemed to the Regent a clap of
thunder; the poor man changed colour three or four times in the
course of a minute, as if we had shown our death warrant.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is fortunate for us,&rdquo; said we to Ki-Chan,
&ldquo;that we have met with you in this country.&nbsp; If, by
ill luck, you had not been here, we should have been utterly
unable to convince the Thibetian authorities that these maps are
not our own drawing.&nbsp; But an instructed man like yourself,
conversant with European matters, will at once see that these
maps are not our own work.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ki-Chan was evidently
much flattered by the compliment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, it is
evident,&rdquo; said he, at the first glance, &ldquo;that these
maps are printed.&nbsp; Look here,&rdquo; said he to the Regent;
&ldquo;these maps were not drawn by these men; they were printed
in the kingdom of France.&nbsp; You cannot distinguish that, but
I have been long used to objects, the productions of the Western
Heaven.&rdquo;&nbsp; These words produced a magical effect on the
Regent.&nbsp; His face became radiant, and he looked at us with a
look of satisfaction, and made a gracious movement with his head,
as much as to say, &ldquo;It is well; you are honest
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We could not get off without a little geographical
lecture.&nbsp; We yielded charitably to the wishes of the Regent
and the Chinese ambassador.&nbsp; We indicated with our fingers
on the map of Mercator, China, Tartary, and Thibet, and all the
other countries of the globe.&nbsp; The Regent was amazed at
seeing how far we were from our native land, and what a long
journey we had been obliged to make, by land and water, to come
and pay him a visit in the capital of Thibet.&nbsp; He regarded
us with astonishment, and then raised the thumb of his right
hand, saying, &ldquo;You are men like that,&rdquo; signifying, in
the figurative language of the Thibetians; you are men of a
superlative stamp.&nbsp; After recognising the principal points
of Thibet, the Regent inquired whereabouts was Calcutta?&nbsp;
&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; we said, pointing to a little round speck on
the borders of the sea.&nbsp; &ldquo;And Lha-Ssa: where then is
Lha-Ssa?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Here it is.&rdquo;&nbsp; The eyes
and finger of the Regent went from Lha-Ssa to Calcutta, and from
Calcutta to Lha-Ssa.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Pelings of Calcutta are
very near our frontiers,&rdquo; said he, making a grimace, and
shaking his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;No matter,&rdquo; he added,
&ldquo;here are the Himalaya mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 183--><a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>The course of geography being ended, the maps were
folded up again, placed in their respective cases, and we passed
on to religious subjects.&nbsp; Ki-Chan had long since become
acquainted with these matters.&nbsp; When he was viceroy of the
province of Pe-Tche-Ly, he had sufficiently persecuted the
Christians, to have numerous opportunities of making himself
familiar with everything connected with the Catholic worship; and
he accordingly now displayed his knowledge.&nbsp; He explained
the images, the sacred vases, the ornaments.&nbsp; He even
informed the company that in the box of holy oils there was a
famous remedy for people at death&rsquo;s door.&nbsp; During all
these explanations the Regent was thoughtful and abstracted; his
eyes were constantly turned towards a large host-iron.&nbsp;
These long pincers, terminating in two large lips, seemed to act
powerfully on his imagination.&nbsp; He gave us an inquiring
look, seeming to ask us if this frightful implement was not
something like an infernal machine.&nbsp; He was only re-assured
upon viewing some wafers that we kept in a box, for he then
comprehended the use of this strange object.</p>
<p>The worthy Regent was all joyous and triumphant, when he saw
that we had nothing in our possession calculated to compromise
us.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he to the Chinese ambassador
with a sneer, &ldquo;what do you think of these men?&nbsp; What
must we do with them?&nbsp; These men are Frenchmen, they are
ministers of the religion of the Lord of Heaven, they are honest
men; we must leave them in peace.&rdquo;&nbsp; These flattering
words were received in the saloon with a murmur of approbation,
and the two missionaries, said, from the bottom of their hearts,
<i>Deo gratias</i>.</p>
<p>The porters shouldered our luggage, and we returned to our
lodging with undoubtedly greater alacrity and lighter hearts than
when we had left it.&nbsp; The news of our reinstatement soon
spread through the town, and the Thibetian people hastened from
all quarters to congratulate us.&nbsp; They saluted us heartily,
and the French name was in every one&rsquo;s mouth.&nbsp;
Thenceforward the white Azaras were entirely forgotten.</p>
<p>When we had refurnished our apartments we gave some Tchang-Ka
to the porters, in order that they might drink our health in a
pot of Thibetian small beer, and appreciate the magnanimity of
the French, in not making people work for nothing.</p>
<p>Every one having gone away, we resumed our accustomed
solitude, and solitude inducing reflection, we discovered two
important things.&nbsp; In the first place, that we had not yet
dined, and in the second, that our horses were no longer in the
stable.&nbsp; Whilst we were considering how to get something
quickly cooked, and how to find where our horses were, we saw at
the threshold of our <!-- page 184--><a name="page184"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 184</span>door the governor of the Katchi, who
relieved us from the double embarrassment.&nbsp; This excellent
man having foreseen that our attendance at the court of inquiry
would not allow us time to make our pot boil, came, followed by
two servants carrying a basket of provisions, with an ovation he
had prepared for us.&nbsp; &ldquo;And our horses&mdash;can you
give us any information about them?&nbsp; We no longer see them
in the court?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I was going to tell you about
them; they have been since yesterday evening in the
Regent&rsquo;s stables.&nbsp; During your absence they have felt
neither hunger nor thirst.&nbsp; I heard you say you intended to
sell them&mdash;is it so?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, quite so, these
animals ruin us; and yet they are so thin, no one will buy
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The Regent wants to buy
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The Regent!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,
the Regent himself.&nbsp; Do not smile, it is no jest.&nbsp; How
much do you want for them?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, whatever he
likes to give.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, then, your horses are
purchased,&rdquo; and so saying, the Cashmerian unrolled a small
packet he had under his arm, and laid upon the table two silver
ingots weighing ten ounces each.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;is the price of your two horses.&rdquo;&nbsp; We
thought our beasts, worn and attenuated as they were, not worth
the money, and we conscientiously said so to the governor of the
Katchi; but it was impossible to modify the transaction which had
been all settled and concluded beforehand.&nbsp; The Regent made
out that our horses, although thin, were of an excellent breed,
since they had not succumbed beneath the fatigues of our long
journey.&nbsp; Besides, they had, in his eyes, a special value,
because they had passed through many countries, and particularly
because they had fed on the pastures of Kounboum, the native
place of Tsong-Kaba.&nbsp; Twenty extra ounces of silver in our
low purse was almost a fortune.&nbsp; We could be generous with
it; so, on the spot, we took one of the ingots and placed it on
Samdadchiemba&rsquo;s knees.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is for you,&rdquo;
we said; &ldquo;you will be able with it to clothe yourself in
holiday dress from head to foot.&rdquo;&nbsp; Samdadchiemba
thanked us coldly and awkwardly; then the muscles of his face
became distended, his nostrils swelled, and his large mouth
assumed a smile.&nbsp; At last, he could not restrain his joy; he
rose and made his ingot leap in the air twice or thrice, crying,
&ldquo;This is a famous day!&rdquo;&nbsp; And Samdadchiemba was
right.&nbsp; This day, so sadly begun, had been fortunate beyond
anything we could have expected.&nbsp; We had now, at Lha-Ssa, an
honourable position, and we were to be allowed to labour freely
in the propagation of the gospel.</p>
<p>The next day was still more lucky for us than its predecessor;
putting, as it were, a climax to our prosperity.&nbsp; In the
morning we proceeded, accompanied by the Cashmerian governor, to
the palace <!-- page 185--><a name="page185"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 185</span>of the Regent, to whom we desired to
express our gratitude for the manifestations of interest with
which he had honoured us.&nbsp; We were received with kindness
and cordiality.&nbsp; He told us, in confidence, that the Chinese
were jealous of our being at Lha-Ssa; but that we might count on
his protection, and reside freely in the country, without any one
having a right to interfere with us.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are very
badly lodged,&rdquo; added he; &ldquo;your room seemed to me
dirty, small, and uncomfortable.&nbsp; I would have strangers
like you, men come from so great a distance, well treated at
Lha-Ssa.&nbsp; In your country of France, do they not treat
strangers well?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;They treat them
excellently.&nbsp; Oh, if you could but go there some day, you
would see how our Emperor would receive you.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Strangers are guests; you must leave your present abode; I
have ordered a suitable lodging to be prepared for you in one of
my houses.&rdquo;&nbsp; We accepted this generous offer with
grateful thanks.&nbsp; To be lodged comfortably and free of
expense was not a thing for men in our position to despise; but
we appreciated, above all, the advantage of residing in one of
the Regent&rsquo;s own houses.&nbsp; So signal a favour, such
emphatic protection, on the part of the Thibetian authorities,
could not but give us with the inhabitants of Lha-Ssa great moral
influence, and facilitate our apostolic mission.</p>
<p>On leaving the palace, we proceeded, without loss of time, to
visit the house which had been assigned to us; it was
superb&mdash;charming.&nbsp; The same evening we effected our
removal, and took possession of our new dwelling.</p>
<p>Our first care was to erect in our house a small chapel.&nbsp;
We selected the largest and best apartment; we papered it as
neatly as possible, and we then adorned it with holy
images.&nbsp; Oh! how our hearts flowed with joy, when we were at
length allowed to pray publicly at the foot of the cross, in the
very heart of the capital of Buddhism, which, perhaps, had never
before beheld the sign of our redemption.&nbsp; What a comfort to
us to be able, at length, to announce the words of life to the
ears of these poor people, sitting for so many ages in the shadow
of death.&nbsp; This little chapel was certainly poor, but it was
to our minds that hundredfold which God has promised to those who
renounce all things for his service.&nbsp; Our hearts were so
full, that we thought we had cheaply bought the happiness we now
enjoyed, by two years of suffering and tribulation in the
desert.</p>
<p>Every one at Lha-Ssa visited the chapel of the French Lamas;
many, after satisfying themselves with asking us a few
explanations as to the meaning of the images they beheld, went
away, putting off till some other time further instruction in the
holy doctrine of <!-- page 186--><a name="page186"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 186</span>Jehovah; but several felt inwardly
struck, and seemed to attach a great importance to the study of
the truths we had come to announce.&nbsp; Every day they came to
us regularly, they read with attention the summary of the
Christian religion, which we had composed at the Lamasery of
Kounboum, and entreated us to tell them the &ldquo;true
prayers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Thibetians were not the only persons who seemed zealous to
study our holy religion.&nbsp; Among the Chinese, the secretaries
of the ambassador Ki-Chan often came to visit us, to hear about
the great doctrine of the west; one of them, to whom we lent some
works written in Tartaro-Mantchou, was convinced of the truth of
Christianity and of the necessity of embracing it, but he had not
courage enough to make an open profession of faith, whilst he was
attached to the embassy; he wished to wait until he should be
free to return to his country.&nbsp; God grant that his good
intentions may not vanish.</p>
<p>A physician, a native of the province of Yun-Nan, displayed
more courage.&nbsp; This young man, since his arrival at Lha-Ssa,
had led so strange a life, that everyone called him the Chinese
hermit.&nbsp; He never went out, except to visit his patients,
and ordinarily he only visited the poor.&nbsp; The wealthy in
vain solicited his attendance; he disdained to notice their
invitations, unless compelled by necessity to obtain some aid,
for he never took anything from the poor, to whose service he had
devoted himself.&nbsp; The time not absorbed in visiting his
patients, he consecrated to study; he passed, indeed, the greater
part of the night over his books.&nbsp; He slept little, and only
took, throughout the day, one single meal of barley-meal, never
eating meat.&nbsp; You needed, indeed, only to see him to be
convinced that he led a hard and self-denying life; his face was
extremely pale and thin, and although he was not more than thirty
years old, his hair was almost entirely white.</p>
<p>One day, he paid us a visit while we were repeating our
breviary in our little chapel; he stopped short a few steps from
the door, and awaited in grave silence.&nbsp; A large coloured
image, representing the Crucifixion, had no doubt fixed his
attention; for, as soon as we had finished our prayers, he asked
us abruptly and without staying to make the usual salutations, to
explain to him the meaning of that image.&nbsp; When we had
answered his question, he crossed his arms upon his chest, and
without uttering a single word, remained motionless, his eyes
fixed upon the image of the Crucifixion; he retained this
position for nearly half-an-hour; at length his eyes were filled
with tears.&nbsp; He extended his arms towards the Christ, fell
on his knees, struck the earth thrice with his forehead, and
rose, exclaiming, &ldquo;That is the only Buddha that <!-- page
187--><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>men ought to worship.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then turned to
us, and after making a profound bow, added, &ldquo;You are my
masters, accept me as your disciple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this surprised us greatly.&nbsp; We could not help
believing that a powerful impulse of grace had moved his
heart.&nbsp; We briefly explained to him the principal points of
the Christian religion, and to all we told him, he simply replied
with an expression of faith truly astonishing, &ldquo;I
believe!&rdquo;&nbsp; We presented to him a small crucifix of
gilt copper, and asked him if he would accept it.&nbsp; His only
answer was an earnest inclination of the head.&nbsp; As soon as
he had the crucifix in his hand, he solicited us to give him a
cord, and he immediately hung the cross round his neck; he then
asked what prayer he ought to recite before the cross?&nbsp;
&ldquo;We will lend you,&rdquo; we said, &ldquo;some Chinese
books, wherein you will find explanations of the doctrine, and
numerous forms of prayer.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;My masters, that is
well; but I wish to have a short and easy prayer, which I can
learn immediately, and repeat often and everywhere.&rdquo;&nbsp;
We taught him to say, &ldquo;Jesus, Saviour of the world, have
mercy on me.&rdquo;&nbsp; For fear of forgetting these words, he
wrote them on a piece of paper, which he placed in a small purse,
suspended from his girdle; he then went away, assuring us that
the recollection of this day would never be effaced from his
memory.</p>
<p>This young physician applied himself with ardour to learn the
truths of the Christian religion; but the most remarkable
circumstance was, that he took no pains to hide the faith he had
in his heart.&nbsp; When he came to visit us, or when we met him
in the streets, he always had the crucifix glittering on his
breast, and he never failed to approach us with the words,
&ldquo;Jesus, Saviour of the world, have mercy on
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was the form of saluting us which he had
adopted.</p>
<p>Whilst we were making efforts to spread the evangelical seed
amongst the population of Lha-Ssa, we did not neglect the
endeavour to sow the divine seed also in the very palace of the
Regent, and this not without the hope of reaping there one day a
precious harvest.&nbsp; Since our trial, so to speak, our
intercourse with the Regent had become frequent, and even
intimate.&nbsp; Almost every evening, when he had finished his
labours of ministry, he invited us to partake with him his
Thibetian repast, to which he always added for ourselves some
dishes cooked in the Chinese fashion.&nbsp; Our conversations
generally extended far into the night.</p>
<p>The Regent was a man of extraordinary capacity; of humble
extraction, he had raised himself gradually, and by his own
merits, to the dignity of First Kalon.&nbsp; This had occurred
three years before.&nbsp; Up to that time he had always fulfilled
arduous and laborious <!-- page 188--><a name="page188"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 188</span>
<a href="images/p188.jpg">
<img class='clearcenter' alt=

</a> functions; he had frequently traversed, in all directions,
the immense regions of Thibet, either to make war or to negotiate
with the neighbouring states, or to inspect the conduct of the
Houtouktou governors of the various provinces.&nbsp; So active,
so busy a life, so apparently incompatible with study, had not
prevented him from acquiring a profound knowledge of Lamanesque
works.</p>
<p>Everyone concurred in saying that the knowledge of the most
renowned Lamas was inferior to that of the Regent.&nbsp; The
facility with which he conducted public business was matter of
especial admiration.&nbsp; One day we were with him, when they
brought him a great many rolls of paper, dispatches from the
provinces; a sort of secretary unrolled them one after the other,
and gave them to him to read, bending on one knee.&nbsp; The
Regent hastily ran his eye over them, without interrupting the
conversation with us.&nbsp; As soon as he had gathered the
contents of a dispatch, he took his bamboo stile, and wrote his
orders at the bottom of the roll, and thus transacted all <!--
page 189--><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>his affairs with promptitude, and as if for
amusement.&nbsp; We are not competent to judge of the literary
merit that was attributed to the First Kalon.&nbsp; We can only
say that we never saw Thibetian writing so beautiful as his.</p>
<p>The Regent was very fond of engaging in religious discussions,
and they most frequently formed the subject of our
conversations.&nbsp; At the commencement, he said to us these
remarkable words:&mdash;&ldquo;All your long journeys you have
undertaken solely with a religious object.&nbsp; You are quite
right, for religion is the thing most essential to man.&nbsp; I
see that the French and the Thibetians have the same view on that
subject.&nbsp; We do not at all resemble the Chinese, who hold
the soul of no account; yet your religion is not the same as
ours.&nbsp; It is important we should ascertain which is the true
one.&nbsp; Let us, then, examine both carefully and sincerely; if
yours is right, we will adopt it; how could we refuse to do
so?&nbsp; If, on the contrary, ours is the true religion, I
believe you will have the good sense to follow it.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This arrangement seemed to us excellent; we could not at the time
desire better.</p>
<p>We commenced with Christianity.&nbsp; The Regent, always
amiable and polished in his conversation with us, said that, as
we were his guests, our belief ought to have the honour of
priority.&nbsp; We successively reviewed the dogmatical and moral
truths.&nbsp; To our great astonishment, the Regent did not seem
surprised at anything we said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your religion,&rdquo;
he incessantly repeated, &ldquo;is conformable with ours; the
truths are the same: we only differ in the explanations.&nbsp; Of
what you have seen and heard in Tartary and Thibet, there is,
doubtless, much to blame; but you must not forget that the
numerous errors and superstitions you may have observed, were
introduced by ignorant Lamas, and that they are rejected by
well-informed Buddhists.&rdquo;&nbsp; He only admitted, between
him and us, two points of difference&mdash;the origin of the
world, and the transmigration of souls.&nbsp; The belief of the
Regent, though it here and there seemed to approximate to the
Catholic doctrine, nevertheless resulted in a vast pantheism; but
he affirmed that we also arrived at the same result, and he did
his best to convince us of this.</p>
<p>The Thibetian language, essentially religious and mystic,
conveys with much clearness and precision all the ideas
respecting the human soul and divinity.&nbsp; Unfortunately, we
were not sufficiently versed in this language, and were
compelled, in our conversations with the Regent, to have recourse
to the Cashmerian governor to interpret for us; but, as he
himself was not very skilful in rendering metaphysical ideas into
Chinese, it was often difficult to understand each other.&nbsp;
One day, the Regent said to us, &ldquo;The truth is clear in <!--
page 190--><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>itself, but if you envelope it in obscure words, one
cannot perceive it.&nbsp; So long as we are obliged to
communicate in Chinese, it will be impossible to make ourselves
intelligible to each other.&nbsp; We shall never be able to
discuss the matter to advantage, till you speak the Thibetian
language fluently.&rdquo;&nbsp; We quite concurred in the justice
of this observation.&nbsp; We replied to the Regent, that the
study of the Thibetian tongue was a great object of solicitude
with us, and that we laboured hard at it every day.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If you like,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I will facilitate your
acquisition of it.&rdquo;&nbsp; And thereupon he called a servant
and said to him a few words which we did not understand.</p>
<p>A youth, elegantly dressed, immediately came, and saluted us
with much grace.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is my nephew,&rdquo; said the
Regent; &ldquo;I present him to you as at once tutor and pupil;
he will pass the whole day with you, and you will thus have the
opportunity of practising the Thibetian language; in return, you
will give him some lessons in Chinese and Mantchou.&rdquo;&nbsp;
We gratefully adopted this proposition, and were enabled, by this
means, to make rapid progress in the language of the
country.&nbsp; The Regent was very fond of talking about France,
during our long visits; he asked us a number of questions about
the manners, customs, and productions of our country.&nbsp; All
we told him of the steam-boats, the railways, the balloons, gas,
telegraphs, the daguerrotype, our industrial productions,
completely amazed him, and gave him an immense idea of the
grandeur and power of France.&nbsp; One day when we were talking
to him of observatories and astronomical instruments, he asked if
we would allow him to examine closely the strange and curious
machine which we kept in a box: he meant the microscope.&nbsp; As
we were in a better humour and infinitely more amiable than when
the officers inspected our property, we readily satisfied the
curiosity of the Regent.&nbsp; One of us ran to our residence,
and returned immediately with the wonderful instrument.&nbsp;
While adjusting, we tried to give our auditor, as well as we
could, some notions of optics, but seeing that the theory did not
excite much enthusiasm, we proceeded at once to the
practice.&nbsp; We asked if one of the company would be so good
as to procure us a louse.&nbsp; The article was easier to find
than a butterfly.&nbsp; A noble Lama, secretary to his excellency
the First Kalon, had merely to put his hand under his silk dress
to his armpit, and an extremely vigorous louse was at our
disposition.&nbsp; We seized it by the sides with our nippers,
but the Lama forthwith opposed this proceeding, and insisted upon
putting a stop to the experiment, on the ground that we were
going to cause the death of a living being.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do not
be afraid,&rdquo; we said, &ldquo;your louse is only taken by the
skin; besides, he seems strong enough to get over the pressure,
even were it greater.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Regent <!-- page 191--><a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>who, as we
have before mentioned, had religious theories superior to those
of the common herd, told the Lama to be silent, and to allow us
to proceed.&nbsp; We continued the experiment, and fixed in the
glass the poor little beast, that struggled, with all its might,
at the extremity of the nippers.&nbsp; We then requested the
Regent to apply his right eye, shutting his left, to the glass at
the top of the machine.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tsong-Kaba!&rdquo; exclaimed
the Regent, &ldquo;the louse is as big as a rat.&rdquo;&nbsp;
After looking at it for a moment, he raised his head and hid his
face with both hands, saying, it was horrible to look at.&nbsp;
He tried to dissuade the others from examining it; but his
influence failed to make any impression.&nbsp; Everyone, in his
turn, looked through the microscope, and started back with cries
of horror.&nbsp; The Lama secretary, seeing that his little
animal scarcely moved, advanced a claim in its favour.&nbsp; We
removed the nippers, and let the louse fall into the hands of its
owner.&nbsp; But, alas! the poor victim did not move.&nbsp; The
Regent said, laughingly, to his secretary, &ldquo;I think your
louse is unwell; go and see if you can get it to take some
physic, otherwise it will not recover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one wishing to see other living creatures, we continued the
entertainment, by passing a small collection of microscopical
pictures before the eyes of the spectators.&nbsp; Every one was
charmed, and exclaimed with admiration, &ldquo;What prodigious
capacity the French have!&rdquo;&nbsp; The Regent told us,
&ldquo;Your railways and your aerial ships no longer astonish me
so much; men who can invent such a machine as that, are capable
of anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The First Kalon was so delighted with the productions of our
country, that he took a fancy to study the French language.&nbsp;
One evening, we brought him, in accordance with his wish, a
French alphabet, each letter of which had the pronunciation
written beneath it in Thibetian characters.&nbsp; He ran his eye
over it, and when we proposed to give him some explanations, he
replied, that they were not necessary, as what we had written was
quite clear.</p>
<p>The next day, as soon as we appeared in his presence, he asked
us what was the name of our emperor.&nbsp; &ldquo;Our emperor is
called Louis Philippe.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Louis Philippe! Louis
Philippe! very well.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then took his style, and
began to write.&nbsp; An instant afterwards he gave us a piece of
paper, on which was written, in very well formed characters,
LOUY-FELIPE.</p>
<p>During the brief period of our prosperity at Lha-Ssa, we had
also tolerably intimate communication with the Chinese ambassador
Ki-Chan.&nbsp; He sent for us twice or thrice, to talk politics,
or, as the Chinese phrase it, to speak idle words.&nbsp; We were
much surprised to find him so intimately acquainted with the
affairs of Europe.&nbsp; He spoke a good deal about the English
and Queen Victoria.&nbsp; &ldquo;It <!-- page 192--><a
name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
192</span>appears,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that this woman has
great abilities; but her husband, in my opinion, plays a very
ridiculous part; she does not let him meddle with anything.&nbsp;
She laid out for him a magnificent garden full of fruit-trees and
flowers of all sorts, and there he is always shut up, passing his
time walking about.&nbsp; They say that in Europe there are other
countries where women rule.&nbsp; Is it so?&nbsp; Are their
husbands also shut up in gardens?&nbsp; Have you in the kingdom
of France any such usage?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, in France the
women are in the gardens, and the men in the state.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;That is right, otherwise all is disorder.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>Ki-Chan inquired about Palmerston; and whether he was still at
the head of foreign affairs.&nbsp; &ldquo;And Ilu, <a
name="citation192"></a><a href="#footnote192"
class="citation">[192]</a> what has become of him?&nbsp; Do you
know him?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He was recalled; your fall involved
his.&rdquo;&nbsp; <!-- page 193--><a name="page193"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 193</span>&ldquo;That is a pity.&nbsp; Ilu had
an excellent heart, but he was devoid of prompt resolution.&nbsp;
Has he been put to death or banished?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Neither
the one nor the other.&nbsp; In Europe they do not proceed to
such extremities as you at Peking.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ay, truly;
your Mandarins are more fortunate than we: your government is
better than ours: our Emperor cannot know everything, and yet he
judges everything, and no one may presume to object.&nbsp; Our
Emperor tells us, That is white; we prostrate ourselves and
answer, Yes, that is white; he then points to the same thing, and
says, That is black; we again prostrate ourselves and reply, Yes,
that is black.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But if you were to say that a
thing cannot be at once white and black?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The
Emperor would perhaps say to a person who exhibited such courage,
You are right; but, at the same time, he would have him strangled
or beheaded.&nbsp; Oh, we have not like you a general assembly of
the chiefs (Tchoung-Teou-Y; so Ki-Chan designated the Chamber of
Deputies).&nbsp; If your Emperor wished to act contrary to
justice, your Tchoung-Teou-Y would be there to stop
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ki-Chan related to us the strange manner in which the great
affair of the English in 1839 had been managed at Peking.&nbsp;
The Emperor convoked the eight Tchoung-Tang who constituted his
privy council, and spoke to them of the events that had occurred
in the south.&nbsp; He told them that some adventurers from the
western seas had manifested themselves rebellious and
insubordinate; that they must be taken and punished severely, in
order to give an example to all who might be tempted to imitate
their misconduct.&nbsp; After thus stating his opinion, the
Emperor asked the advice of his council.&nbsp; The four Mantchou
Tchoung-Tang prostrated themselves and said, &ldquo;Tch&eacute;,
tch&eacute;, tch&eacute;, Tchou-Dze-Ti, Fan-Fou.&rdquo;&nbsp;
(Yes, yes, yes; such is the command of the master.)&nbsp; The
four Chinese Tchoung-Tang prostrated themselves in their turn,
and said, &ldquo;Ch&eacute;, ch&eacute;, ch&eacute;,
Hoang-Chang-Ti, Tien-Ngen.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Yes, yes, yes; it is the
celestial benefit of the Emperor.)&nbsp; After this, nothing
further had to be said, and the council was dismissed.&nbsp; This
anecdote is perfectly authentic, for Ki-Chan is one of the eight
Tchoung-Tang of the empire.&nbsp; He added that, for his part, he
was persuaded that the Chinese were incapable of contending
against the Europeans, unless they altered their weapons and
changed their old habits; but that he should take care not to say
so to the Emperor, because, besides that the suggestion would be
futile in itself, it would perhaps cost him his life.</p>
<p>Our frequent conferences with the Chinese ambassador, the
Regent, and the Cashmerian governor, contributed not a little to
secure for us the confidence and consideration of the inhabitants
of Lha-Ssa.&nbsp; On seeing the number of those who came to visit
us, <!-- page 194--><a name="page194"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 194</span>and to be instructed in our holy
religion, augment from day to day, we felt our hopes enlarge and
our courage increase.&nbsp; Yet, amidst these consolations, one
thought constantly vexed us; it was that we could not present to
the Thibetians the inspiring spectacle of the pompous and
touching festivals of Catholicism.&nbsp; We were convinced that
the beauty of our ceremonies would have a powerful influence over
the minds of these people, so eager after all that appertains to
external worship.</p>
<p>The Thibetians, as we have already observed, are eminently
religious; but, with the exception of a few contemplative Lamas,
who withdraw to the summits of mountains and pass their lives in
the hollows of rocks, they are very little disposed to
mysticism.&nbsp; Instead of confining their devotion within their
inner hearts, they like, on the contrary, display by outward
acts; and accordingly pilgrimages, noisy ceremonies in the
Lamaseries, prostrations on the tops of their houses, are
practices extremely to their taste.&nbsp; They always have in
their hands the Buddhist rosary, turning and twisting it, and
incessantly murmur prayers, even when they are engaged in
business.</p>
<p>There exists at Lha-Ssa a very touching custom, and which we
felt a sort of jealousy at finding among infidels.&nbsp; In the
evening, just as the day is verging on its decline, all the
Thibetians stay business, and meet together, men, women and
children, according to their sex and age, in the principal parts
of the town, and in the public squares.&nbsp; As soon as groups
are formed, everyone kneels down, and they begin slowly and in
undertones to chant prayers.</p>
<p>The religious concerts produced by these numerous assemblages
create throughout the town an immense solemn harmony, which
operates forcibly on the soul.&nbsp; The first time we witnessed
this spectacle, we could not help drawing a painful comparison
between this pagan town, where all prayed together, and the
cities of Europe, where people would blush to make the sign of
the cross in public.&nbsp; The prayer which the Thibetians chant
in these evening assemblies, varies according to the seasons of
the year; that, on the contrary, which they repeat on their
rosary, is always the same and only consists of six
syllables&mdash;<i>Om mani padme houm</i>.&nbsp; This formula,
which the Buddhists call, by abbreviation, the mani, is not only
in everyone&rsquo;s mouth, but you see it written everywhere
about, in the streets, in the squares, and in houses.&nbsp; On
all the flags that float above the doors, or from the summit of
the public edifices, there is always a mani printed in Landza,
Tartar, and Thibetian characters.&nbsp; Certain rich and zealous
Buddhists maintain, at their own expense, companies of Lama
sculptors, whose business it is to diffuse the mani.&nbsp; These
singular missionaries travel, chisel and mallet in <!-- page
195--><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>hand, over hill, dale, and desert, engraving the sacred
formula upon the stones and rocks.</p>
<p>According to the opinion of the celebrated orientalist
Klaproth, &ldquo;Om mani padme houm&rdquo; is merely the
Thibetian transcription of a Sanscrit formula brought from India
to Thibet.&nbsp; Towards the middle of the seventh century of our
era, the famous Hindoo Tonmi-Sambhodha introduced writing into
Thibet; but as the Landza alphabet, which he had at first
adopted, seemed to King Srong-Bdzan-Gombo too complex and too
difficult to learn, he invited the learned personage to draw up
an easier writing, better adapted to the Thibetian tongue.&nbsp;
Accordingly, Tonmi-Sambhodha shut himself up for awhile, and
composed the Thibetian writing now in use, and which is merely a
modification of Sanscrit characters.&nbsp; He also initiated the
king into the mysteries of Buddhism, and communicated to him the
sacred formula &ldquo;Om mani padme houm,&rdquo; which spread
rapidly through all the countries of Thibet and Mongolia.</p>
<p>This formula has, in the Sanscrit language, a distinct and
complete meaning, which cannot be traced in the Thibetian
idiom.&nbsp; Om is, among the Hindoos, the mystic name of the
Divinity, with which all their prayers begin.&nbsp; It is
composed of A, the name of Vishnu; of O, that of Siva; and of M,
that of Brahma.&nbsp; This mystic particle is also equivalent to
the interjection O, and expresses a profound religious
conviction; it is, as it were, a formula of the act of faith;
mani signifies a gem, a precious thing; padma, the lotus; padme,
the vocative of the same word.&nbsp; Lastly, houm is a particle
expressing a wish, a desire, and is equivalent to our Amen.&nbsp;
The literal sense, then, of this phrase is this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Om mani padme houm.</p>
<p>O the gem in the lotus, Amen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Buddhists of Thibet and Mongolia have not been content
with this clear and precise meaning, and have tortured their
imaginations in their endeavours to find a mystic interpretation
of each of the six syllables composing the sentence.</p>
<p>They have written an infinity of voluminous books, wherein
they have piled one extravagance on another, to explain their
famous mani.&nbsp; The Lamas are wont to say that the doctrine
contained in these marvellous words is immense, and that the
whole life of a man is insufficient to measure its breadth and
depth.&nbsp; We were anxious to know what the Regent thought of
this formula.&nbsp; This is what he said on the subject:
&ldquo;Living beings, in Thibetian semdchan, and in Mongol
amitan, are divided into six classes&mdash;angels, demons, men,
quadrupeds, birds, and reptiles. <a name="citation195"></a><a
href="#footnote195" class="citation">[195]</a>&nbsp; <!-- page
196--><a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>These six classes of living beings correspond to the
six syllables of the formula &lsquo;Om mani padme
houm.&rsquo;&nbsp; Living beings, by continual transformations,
and according to their merit or demerit, pass about in these six
classes until they have attained the apex of perfection, when
they are absorbed and lost in the grand essence of Buddha; that
is to say, in the eternal and universal soul, whence emanate all
souls, and wherein all souls, after their temporary evolutions,
are destined to meet and become fused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Living beings have, according to the class to which
they belong, particular means of sanctifying themselves, of
rising to a superior class, of obtaining perfection, and
arriving, in process of time, at the period of their
absorption.&nbsp; Men who repeat very frequently and devotedly
&lsquo;Om mani padme houm,&rsquo; escape falling, after death,
into the six classes of animate creatures corresponding to the
six syllables of the formula, and obtain the plenitude of being
by their absorption into the eternal and universal soul of
Buddha.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We know not whether this explanation, which was given to us by
the Regent himself, is generally adopted by the learned Buddhists
of Thibet and Mongolia.&nbsp; We may, however, observe, as it
appears to us, that it bears some analogy with the literal
meaning: Oh, the gem in the lotus, Amen.&nbsp; The gem being the
emblem of perfection, and the lotus of Buddha, it may perhaps be
considered that these words express the desire to acquire
perfection in order to be united with Buddha, to be absorbed in
the universal soul.&nbsp; The symbolic formula, Oh, the gem in
the lotus, Amen, might then be paraphrased thus: Oh, may I obtain
perfection, and be absorbed in Buddha, Amen.</p>
<p>According to the explanation of the Regent, the mani would be,
as it were, the summary of a vast pantheism, the basis of the
whole belief of the Buddhists.&nbsp; The learned Lamas say that
Buddha is the necessary, the independent Being, the Beginning and
End of all things.&nbsp; The earth, the stars, mankind,
everything that exists is a partial and temporal manifestation of
Buddha.&nbsp; Everything was created by Buddha; in this sense,
that everything proceeds from him, as light proceeds from the
sun.&nbsp; All creatures sprung from Buddha, have had a
beginning, and will have an end; but in the same way that they
have necessarily sprung from the universal essence, they will
necessarily return to it.&nbsp; It is as the rivers and the
torrents produced by the waters of the sea, and which, after a
course, more or less long, proceed again to lose themselves in
its immensity.&nbsp; So Buddha is eternal; his manifestations
also are eternal; but in this sense, that there have been
manifestations, and that there always will be manifestations,
though taken separately, they have a beginning and an end.</p>
<p><!-- page 197--><a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
197</span>Without inquiring too nicely whether this agrees or not
with what precedes, the Buddhists admit, besides, an unlimited
number of divine incarnations.&nbsp; They say that Buddha assumes
a human body, and comes to dwell among men, in order to aid them
in acquiring perfection, and to facilitate for them their reunion
with the universal soul.&nbsp; These Living Buddhas constitute
the numerous class of Chaberons, whom we have frequently noticed
before.&nbsp; The most celebrated Living Buddhas are&mdash;at
Lha-Ssa, the Tal&eacute;-Lama; at Djachi-Loumbo, the
Bandchan-Remboutchi; at the Grand Kouren, the Guison-Tamba; at
Peking, the Tchang-Kia-Fo, a sort of grand almoner of the
imperial court; and in the country of the Ssamba, at the foot of
the Himalaya mountains, the Sa-Dcha-Fo.&nbsp; This last has, they
say, a somewhat singular mission.&nbsp; He prays night and day,
in order to get the snow to fall continuously on the summit of
the Himalaya; for, according to a Thibetian tradition, there
exists behind these lofty mountains a savage and cruel people,
who only await the subsidence of the snow to come over and
massacre the Thibetian tribes, and to take possession of the
country.</p>
<p>Although all the Chaberons are, without distinction, Living
Buddhas, there is, nevertheless, among them, a hierarchy, of
which the Tal&eacute;-Lama is the head.&nbsp; All the rest
acknowledge, or ought to acknowledge, his supremacy.&nbsp; The
present Tal&eacute;-Lama, as we have said, is a child of nine
years old, and he has now for six years occupied the palace of
the Buddha-La.&nbsp; He is a Si-Fan by birth, and was taken from
a poor and obscure family of the principality of
Ming-Tchen-Tou-Sse.</p>
<p>When the Tal&eacute;-Lama dies, or to speak Buddhickly, when
he has laid aside his human envelope, they proceed to the
election of his successor, in the following manner: Prayers are
directed to be offered up, and fasts to be performed in all the
Lamaseries.&nbsp; The inhabitants of Lha-Ssa especially, as being
the most interested in the affair, redouble their zeal and
devotion.&nbsp; Every one goes a pilgrimage round the Buddha-La
and the &ldquo;City of Spirits.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Tchu-Kors are
perpetually turning in everybody&rsquo;s hands, the sacred
formula of the mani re-echoes day and night, in all the streets
of the town, and perfumes are burnt in profusion
everywhere.&nbsp; Those who think they possess the
Tal&eacute;-Lama in their family, give information of the belief
to the authorities of Lha-Ssa, in order that there may be
established, in the children so indicated, their quality of
Chaberons.&nbsp; In order to be able to proceed to the election
of the Tal&eacute;-Lama, there must be discovered three
Chaberons, authentically recognised as such.&nbsp; The candidates
come to Lha-Ssa, and the Houtouktous of the Lamanesque states
meet in assembly.&nbsp; They shut themselves <!-- page 198--><a
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>up in a
temple of the Buddha-La, and pass six days in retirement, fasting
and praying.&nbsp; On the seventh day, they take a golden urn,
containing three fish, likewise of gold, upon which are engraved
the names of the three little candidates for the functions of the
divinity of the Buddha-La.&nbsp; They shake the urn, the eldest
of the Houtouktous draws out a fish, and the child whose name is
thus designated by lot is immediately proclaimed
Tal&eacute;-Lama.&nbsp; He is then conducted, in great pomp, to
the street of the City of Spirits, every one devoutly prostrating
himself on his passage, and is placed in his sanctuary.</p>
<p>The two Chaberons in swaddling clothes, who have contested for
the place of Tal&eacute;-Lama, are carried back by their nurses
to their respective families; but to compensate them for not
having succeeded, government makes them a present of 500 ounces
of silver.</p>
<p>The Tal&eacute;-Lama is venerated by the Thibetians and the
Mongols like a divinity.&nbsp; The influence he exercises over
the Buddhist population is truly astonishing; but still it is
going too far to say that his excrements are respectfully
collected, and made into amulets which devotees enclose in
pouches and carry round their necks.&nbsp; It is equally untrue
that the Tal&eacute;-Lama has his arms and head encircled with
serpents, in order to strike the imagination of his
worshippers.&nbsp; These assertions, which we read in some
geographies, are entirely without foundation.&nbsp; During our
stay at Lha-Ssa, we asked a good many questions on this point,
and every one laughed in our faces.&nbsp; Unless it could be made
out that, from the Regent to our argol merchant, all conspired to
hide the truth from us, it must be admitted that the narratives,
which have given circulation to such fables, were written with
but very little caution.</p>
<p>It was not possible for us to get a sight of the
Tal&eacute;-Lama; not that there is any great difficulty made in
admitting the curious, or devotees, to see him, but we were
prevented by a rather singular circumstance.&nbsp; The Regent had
promised to take us to the Buddha-La, and we were upon the point
of fulfilling this notable visit, when all of a sudden an alarm
was started that we should give the Tal&eacute;-Lama the
small-pox.&nbsp; This malady had, in fact, just manifested itself
at Lha-Ssa, and the people declared, that it had been brought
from Peking, by the great caravan which arrived a few days
before.&nbsp; As we had formed part of that caravan, we were
asked whether it would not be better to postpone our visit, in
order that we might not expose the Tal&eacute;-Lama to the risk
of catching the disease.&nbsp; The proposition was too reasonable
to admit of our making any objection.</p>
<p>The fear which the Thibetians have of the small-pox is <!--
page 199--><a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
199</span>something inconceivable.&nbsp; They never mention its
name even, without a sort of stupor, as though they were speaking
of the greatest scourge that could by possibility desolate
mankind.&nbsp; And, indeed, there is no year in which this malady
does not make fearful ravages at Lha-Ssa, and the only remedy
which has hitherto suggested itself to the government as a
preservative for the population against this fearful epidemic, is
to proscribe the wretched families who are seized with it.&nbsp;
As soon as the small-pox has declared itself in a house, all the
inhabitants must dislodge, and repair, whether they will or not,
far from the city to the summits of the mountains, or the depths
of the valleys.&nbsp; No one may hold any communication whatever
with the poor wretches, who soon die of hunger and privation, or
become the prey of wild beasts.&nbsp; We did not fail to make the
Regent acquainted with the precious means used by the European
nations to preserve themselves from the disorder; and one of the
chief circumstances, which procured for us the good-will and
protection of the Regent, was his hope that we might one day
introduce vaccination into Thibet.&nbsp; The missionary who
should be fortunate enough to endow the Thibetians with so
invaluable a blessing, would assuredly acquire over their minds
an influence capable of competing with that of the
Tal&eacute;-Lama itself.&nbsp; The introduction of vaccination
into Thibet by the missionaries would, not improbably, be the
signal of the downfall of Lamanism, and of the establishment of
the Christian religion among these infidel tribes.</p>
<p>People afflicted with the itch and leprosy, are numerous at
Lha-Ssa.&nbsp; These cutaneous diseases are engendered by the
want of cleanliness, more peculiarly prevalent among the lower
classes of the population.&nbsp; Cases of hydrophobia are not
unfrequent among the Thibetians; and one is only surprised that
this horrible malady does not commit greater ravages, when one
bears in mind the terrible multitudes of gaunt, famishing dogs
that are always prowling about the streets of Lha-Ssa.&nbsp;
These animals, in fact, are so numerous in that city, that the
Chinese contemptuously say, that the three great products of the
capital of Thibet, are Lamas, women, and dogs&mdash;Lama,
Ya-Teou, Keou.</p>
<p>This marvellous infinitude of dogs arises from the extreme
respect which the Thibetians have for these animals, and the use
to which they apply them in burying the dead.&nbsp; There are
four different species of sepulture practised in Thibet; the
first, combustion; the second, immersion in the rivers and lakes;
the third, exposure on the summit of mountains; and the fourth,
which is considered the most complimentary of all, consists in
cutting the dead body in pieces, and giving these to be eaten by
<!-- page 200--><a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
200</span>the dogs.&nbsp; The last method is by far the most
popular.&nbsp; The poor have only as their mausoleum the common
vagabond dogs of the locality; but the more distinguished defunct
are treated with greater ceremony.&nbsp; In all the Lamaseries, a
number of dogs are kept <i>ad hoc</i>, and within them the rich
Thibetians are buried. <a name="citation200"></a><a

<p>We have already referred to the travels of Moorcroft in
Thibet, in noticing the excessive fear with which the designers
and makers of geographical charts inspire the Thibetian
government.&nbsp; One day, the governor of the Cashmerians
brought to us one of his fellow <!-- page 202--><a
name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>countrymen,
named Nisan, who had been for a long time the servant of
Moorcroft at Lha-Ssa.&nbsp; He talked to us at some length about
his old master, and the details he gave us confirmed all that had
already been related to us.&nbsp; The adventures of this English
traveller appearing to us too singular to be passed over wholly
in silence, we have thought proper to give a short review of
them.</p>
<p>According to the statements collected in the capital of Thibet
itself, Moorcroft arrived from Ladak at Lha-Ssa in the year 1826;
he wore the Mussulman dress, and spoke the Farsie language,
expressing himself in that idiom with so much facility, that the
Cashmerians of Lha-Ssa took him for one of their
countrymen.&nbsp; He hired a house in the town, where he lived
for twelve years with his servant Nisan, whom he had brought from
Ladak, and who himself thought that his master was a
Cashmerian.&nbsp; Moorcroft had purchased a few herds of goats
and oxen, which he had confided to the care of some Thibetian
shepherds, who dwelt in the gorges of the mountains, about
Lha-Ssa.&nbsp; Under the pretext of inspecting his herds, the
feigned Mussulman went freely about the country, making drawings
and preparing his geographical charts.&nbsp; It is said that
never having learnt the Thibetian language, he abstained from
holding direct communication with the people of the
country.&nbsp; At last, having dwelt for twelve years at Lha-Ssa,
Moorcroft took his way back to Ladak, but whilst he was in the
province of Ngari, he was attacked by a troop of brigands who
assassinated him.&nbsp; The perpetrators of this murder were
pursued and arrested by the Thibetian government, who recovered a
portion of the property of the English traveller, among which was
a collection of geographical designs and charts.&nbsp; It was
only then, and upon sight of these objects, that the authorities
of Lha-Ssa found out that Moorcroft was an Englishman.</p>
<p>Before separating from his servant, Moorcroft had given him a
note, telling him to show it to the inhabitants of Calcutta, if
he ever went to that city, and that it would suffice to make his
fortune.&nbsp; It was doubtless a letter of recommendation.&nbsp;
The seizure of the effects of Moorcroft created such a
disturbance in Thibet, that Nisan, afraid of being compromised,
destroyed his letter of recommendation.&nbsp; He told us himself
that this note was written in characters exactly similar to
ours.</p>
<p>The facts we have here related, we derive from the Regent,
from the Cashmerian governor, from Nisan, and from several other
inhabitants of Lha-Ssa.&nbsp; Before reaching this town, we had
never heard of Moorcroft; it was there we first learned the name
of this English traveller.&nbsp; From what we have stated, it may
be considered established that Moorcroft really went to Lha-Ssa
in 1826, <!-- page 203--><a name="page203"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 203</span>that he resided there for twelve
years, and that he was afterwards assassinated on the road to
Ladak from Lha-Ssa.</p>
<p>Let us turn now, however, to other information, extremely
discrepant from that which was given us in the capital of
Thibet.&nbsp; According to the &ldquo;Universal Geography&rdquo;
of Charles Ritter, <a name="citation203a"></a><a
href="#footnote203a" class="citation">[203a]</a> Moorcroft made
first a journey in 1812, which lasted two months; he was
afterwards directed by the Company to procure horses from
Turkestan, wherewith to improve the breed of horses in
India.&nbsp; For this purpose he undertook a second journey in
November, 1819; he got as far as Ladak, where he remained two
years.&nbsp; In the month of October, 1822, he left that town for
Cashmere, and on the 25th of August, 1825, died at Andkou, on the
way from Herat to Balk.&nbsp; The death of Moorcroft, at the date
and place stated by Charles Ritter, was announced by his
fellow-traveller, M. Tribeck, in a letter dated Balk, 6th
September, 1825, and addressed to Captain Wade, the resident at
Loudiana. <a name="citation203b"></a><a href="#footnote203b"
class="citation">[203b]</a></p>
<p>We confess that we cannot possibly reconcile such opposite
statements.&nbsp; If Moorcroft was really not at Lha-Ssa, how is
it that he was so well known there, and that the people there
speak of his residence among them in terms so precise?&nbsp; What
interest could the Thibetians have in forging such a tale?&nbsp;
On the other hand, if Moorcroft was at Lha-Ssa, how can we
explain that letter of M. Tribeck, which announces that his
fellow-traveller died in 1825, exactly at the time, when,
according to the other hypothesis, he was on his way to the
capital of Thibet?</p>
<p>Without pretending to reconcile these contradictions, we will
cite a fact which concerns ourselves, and which will, perhaps,
seem to bear some relation to the affair of Moorcroft.&nbsp; Some
time after our arrival at Macao, we read the following article in
the &ldquo;Bengal Catholic Herald,&rdquo; <a
name="citation203c"></a><a href="#footnote203c"
class="citation">[203c]</a> a journal printed at Calcutta.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Canton the 12th September.&nbsp; The French missionaries
of our city have lately received the news of the deplorable death
of two fathers of their mission in Mongol-Tartary.&rdquo;&nbsp;
After a cursory sketch of the Mongol-Chinese territory, the
writer of the article proceeds thus:&mdash;&ldquo;A French
Lazarist called Huc, arrived, about three years ago, amongst some
Chinese families, who were established in the valley of Black
Waters, about two hundred leagues journey from the Great
Wall.&nbsp; Another Lazarist, whose name is unknown to me, <a
name="citation203d"></a><a href="#footnote203d"
class="citation">[203d]</a> joined him in the plan of forming a
mission among the Mongol <!-- page 204--><a
name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>Buddhists.&nbsp; They studied the Mongol language with
the Lamas of the neighbouring Lamaseries.&nbsp; It seems that
they were taken for foreign Lamas, and were treated in a friendly
manner, particularly by the Buddhists, who are very ignorant, and
who mistook the Latin of their breviaries for Sanscrit, which
they do not understand, but for which they have a secret
veneration, because the rites of their religious books, in
Mongol, translated from the Sanscrit, are printed in red ink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the missionaries thought themselves sufficiently
learned in the language, they advanced into the interior, with
the intention of commencing their work of conversion.&nbsp; From
that time only uncertain rumours were heard about them, but in
May last, from the interior of Mongol-Tartary, the news came that
they had been tied to horses&rsquo; tails, and so dragged to
death.&nbsp; The real causes of this event are not as yet
known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whilst they were thus announcing our death so positively, we
were approaching the termination of our long journey, and were
close upon Canton, happily enjoying a health fully capable of
refuting the news thus propagated concerning us.&nbsp; But if, by
chance, we had perished among the mountains of Thibet, if we had
been murdered there, the world would have remained convinced that
we had been tied to horses&rsquo; tails and had died in
Mongolia.&nbsp; It would probably have never been believed that
we had reached the capital of Thibet; and if, at some later time,
some European traveller had visited Lha-Ssa, and had been
informed of our abode in that town, it would have been, perhaps,
just as difficult to reconcile these statements, as those
respecting Moorcroft.&nbsp; Although the death of the English
traveller is a matter which we cannot clear up, we did not
conceive that we could omit to say what we knew of it, without
pretending to invalidate, by the accounts collected at Lha-Ssa,
the documents set forth in the scientific London journals.</p>
<p>We were scarcely a month at Lha-Ssa before the numerous
inhabitants of this town grew accustomed to speak with respect
and admiration of the holy doctrine of Jehovah, and of the great
kingdom of France.&nbsp; The peace and tranquillity we enjoyed,
the distinguished protection which the Thibetian government
extended to us, the sympathy with which the people seemed to
surround us, all inspired us with the hope, that, by the aid of
God, we might lay in the very capital of Buddhism the foundation
of a mission, the influence of which would soon extend itself
among the nomad tribes of Mongolia.&nbsp; The moment seemed to
have come when the Tartar pilgrims might at length learn, at
Lha-Ssa, the only doctrine which can save men&rsquo;s souls, and
civilize nations.</p>
<p>As soon as we considered our position at Lha-Ssa confirmed,
<!-- page 205--><a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
205</span>we turned our thoughts to the means of renewing our
communications with Europe in the speediest manner.&nbsp; The
path of the desert was impracticable.&nbsp; We had, certainly,
managed to cross once, and as it were by a miracle, these steppes
infested by brigands and wild beasts; but it was out of the
question to think of organising a service of couriers along that
frightful route.&nbsp; Supposing, besides, the fullest security
that could be desired, the mere length of the journey was a thing
to make one shudder.&nbsp; The road by India seemed alone
practicable.&nbsp; From Lha-Ssa to the first English station is
not quite a month&rsquo;s journey.&nbsp; By establishing one
correspondent on the other side of the Himalaya mountains, and
one at Calcutta, our communication with France would become, if
not prompt and easy, at all events feasible.&nbsp; As this plan
could only be put into execution with the consent of the
Thibetian government, we communicated it to the Regent, who
immediately entered into our views, and it was agreed that in the
summer M. Gabet should undertake the journey to Calcutta, with a
Thibetian escort, who were to accompany him as far as Boutan.</p>
<p>Such were the plans we were forming for the establishment of a
mission at Lha-Ssa; but at this very moment the enemy to all good
was hard at work to ruin our projects, and to remove us from a
country which he seems to have chosen for the seat of his
empire.&nbsp; Having heard here and there words of evil auspice,
we comprehended that the Chinese ambassador was secretly plotting
our expulsion from Thibet.&nbsp; The vague rumour of this
persecution had, in fact, nothing about it to surprise us.&nbsp;
From the outset, we had foreseen that if difficulties assailed
us, they would emanate from the Chinese Mandarins.&nbsp; Ki-Chan,
in fact, could not bear to see the Thibetian government receive
with so much favour a religion and strangers, whom the absurd
prejudices of China have so long driven from her frontiers.&nbsp;
Christianity and the French name excited too forcibly the
sympathy of the people of Lha-Ssa, not to arouse Chinese
jealousy.&nbsp; An agent of the court of Peking could not,
without anger, reflect on the popularity which strangers enjoyed
in Thibet, and on the influence which they might one day exercise
in a country which China has every interest in keeping under her
dominion.&nbsp; It was determined, therefore, that the preachers
of the religion of the Lord of Heaven should be driven from
Lha-Ssa.</p>
<p>One day, the ambassador, Ki-Chan, sent for us, and after
sundry attempts at cajolery, ended by saying that Thibet was too
cold, too poor a country for us, and that we had better think of
returning to our kingdom of France.&nbsp; Ki-Chan addressed these
words to us, with a sort of indifferent, careless manner, as
though <!-- page 206--><a name="page206"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 206</span>he supposed there could he no sort
of objection to them.&nbsp; We asked him if, in speaking thus, he
proposed to us advice or command.&nbsp; &ldquo;Both the one and
the other,&rdquo; he replied, coldly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Since it is
so, we have first to thank you for the interest which you seem to
have in our welfare, in telling us that this country is cold and
miserable.&nbsp; But you must know, that men such as we, do not
regard the goods and conveniences of this world; were it not so,
we should have remained in our own kingdom of France.&nbsp; For
know, there is not anywhere a country comparable with our
own.&nbsp; As for the imperative portion of your words, this is
our answer: &lsquo;Admitted into Thibet by the local authority,
we recognise no right in you, or in any other person, to disturb
our abode here.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How! you who are
strangers, presume still to remain here?&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, we are strangers, but we know that the laws of Thibet
are not like those of China.&nbsp; The Peboun, the Katchi, the
Mongols, are strangers like us, and yet they are permitted to
live here in peace; no one disturbs them.&nbsp; What, then, is
the meaning of this arbitrary proceeding of yours, in ordering
Frenchmen from a country open to all people?&nbsp; If foreigners
are to quit Lha-Ssa, why do you stay here?&nbsp; Does not your
title of Kin-Tchai (ambassador) distinctly announce that you
yourself are but a foreigner here?&rdquo;&nbsp; At these words,
Ki-Chan bounded on his velvet cushion.&nbsp; &ldquo;I a
foreigner!&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;a foreigner!&nbsp; I, who bear
the authority of the Grand Emperor, who, only a few months&rsquo;
since, condemned and exiled the Nomekhan.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We
are acquainted with that affair.&nbsp; There is this difference
between the Nomekhan and us, that the Nomekhan came from Kan-Sou,
a province of the empire, and we come from France, where your
Grand Emperor is nobody; and that the Nomekhan assassinated three
Tal&eacute;-Lamas, while we have done no injury to any man.&nbsp;
Have we any other aim than to make known to men the true God, and
to teach them the way to save their souls?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ay, as I have already said to you, I believe you to be
honest people; but then the religion you preach has been declared
wicked, and prohibited by our Grand Emperor.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;To these words, we can only reply thus: The religion of
the Lord of Heaven does not need the sanction of your Emperor to
make it a holy religion, any more than we, of its mission, need
it to come and preach in Thibet.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Chinese
ambassador did not think it expedient to continue this
discussion; he drily dismissed us, declaring that we might rest
assured he would make us quit Thibet.&nbsp; We hastened to the
Regent, in order to acquaint him with the melancholy interview we
had had with Ki-Chan.&nbsp; The chief Kalon had been made aware
of the projects of persecution which the Chinese Mandarins were
hatching against us.&nbsp; He endeavoured to reassure us, and
<!-- page 207--><a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
207</span>told us, that protecting in the country thousands of
strangers, he was powerful enough to give us the protection which
the Thibetian government extended to all.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; added he, &ldquo;even though our laws did
prohibit strangers from entering our country, those laws could
not affect you.&nbsp; Religious persons, men of prayer, belonging
to all countries, are strangers nowhere; such is the doctrine
taught by our holy books.&nbsp; It is written: &lsquo;The yellow
goat has no country, the Lama no family.&rsquo;&nbsp; Lha-Ssa
being the peculiar assembling-place and abode of men of prayer,
that title of itself should always secure for you liberty and
protection.&rdquo;&nbsp; This opinion of the Buddhists, which
constitutes a religious man a cosmopolite, is not merely a mystic
idea written in books, but we have found it recognised in the
manners and customs of the Lamaseries; when a man has had his
head shaved, and assumes the religious habit, he renounces his
former name to take a new one.&nbsp; If you ask a Lama of what
country he is, he replies, &ldquo;I have no country, but I pass
my time in such a Lamasery.&rdquo;&nbsp; This manner of thinking
and acting is even admitted in China, amongst the bonzes and
other classes of religionists, who are called by the generic name
of Tchou-Kia-Jin, (a man who has left his family.)</p>
<p>There was, respecting us, a controversy of several days&rsquo;
duration, between the Thibetian government and the Chinese
ambassador.&nbsp; Ki-Chan, in order to insure better success to
his aims, assumed the character of defender of the
Tal&eacute;-Lama.&nbsp; This was his argument: Sent to Lha-Ssa by
his Emperor, to protect the Living Buddha, it was his duty to
remove from him whatever was calculated to injure him.&nbsp;
Certain preachers of the religion of the Lord of Heaven,
animated, no doubt, by excellent intentions, were propagating a
doctrine which, in the end, tended to destroy the authority and
power of the Tal&eacute;-Lama.&nbsp; Their avowed purpose was to
substitute their religious belief for Buddhism, and to convert
all the inhabitants of Thibet of every age, condition, and
sex.&nbsp; What would become of the Tal&eacute;-Lama when he had
no worshippers?&nbsp; The introduction into the country of the
religion of the Lord of Heaven, does it not lead directly to the
destruction of the sanctuary of the Buddha-La, and consequently,
to the downfall of the Lamanesque hierarchy and of the Thibetian
government?&nbsp; &ldquo;I,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;who am here to
protect the Tal&eacute;-Lama, can I permit, at Lha-Ssa, men who
propagate such formidable doctrines?&nbsp; When those doctrines
have taken root, and it is no longer possible to extirpate them,
who will be responsible for such a misfortune?&nbsp; What shall I
reply to the Grand Emperor, when he shall reproach me with my
negligence and cowardice?&nbsp; You Thibetians,&rdquo; said he to
the Regent; &ldquo;you do not comprehend the gravity of this
matter.&nbsp; <!-- page 208--><a name="page208"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 208</span>Because these men are virtuous and
irreproachable, you think they are harmless&mdash;it is a
mistake.&nbsp; If they remain long at Lha-Ssa, they will
spell-bind you.&nbsp; Among you, there is not a man capable of
disputing with them upon religion.&nbsp; You will not be able to
keep from adopting their belief, and then the Tal&eacute;-Lama is
undone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Regent did not enter at all into these apprehensions, with
which the Chinese ambassador endeavoured to inspire him.&nbsp; He
maintained that our presence at Lha-Ssa could not in any way be
prejudicial to the Thibetian government.&nbsp; &ldquo;If the
doctrine which these men held,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is a false
doctrine, the Thibetians will not embrace it; if, on the
contrary, it is true, what have we to fear?&nbsp; How can the
truth be prejudicial to men?&nbsp; These two Lamas of the kingdom
of France,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;have not done any harm; they
are animated with the best intentions towards us.&nbsp; Can we,
without good ground, deprive them of the liberty and protection
which we extend here to all strangers, and particularly to men of
prayer?&nbsp; Can we make ourselves guilty of an actual and
certain injustice, through an imaginary fear of some possible
evil to come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ki-Chan reproached the Regent with neglecting the interests of
the Tal&eacute;-Lama, and the Regent on his part accused Ki-Chan
of taking advantage of the minority of the sovereign, to
tyrannize over the Thibetian government.&nbsp; For our parts, in
this unfortunate contest, we refused to acknowledge the authority
of the Chinese Mandarin, and declared that we would not quit the
country without a formal order from the Regent, who assured us
that they should never extort from him any such thing.</p>
<p>The quarrel became more and more exacerbated every day.&nbsp;
Ki-Chan resolved to take on himself to expel us from the
country.&nbsp; Matters had come to such a crisis, that prudence
obliged us to yield to circumstances, and to oppose no further
resistance, for fear of compromising the Regent, and of becoming,
perhaps, the cause of lamentable dissensions between China and
Thibet.&nbsp; By further opposing this unjust persecution, we
might irritate too vehemently the Chinese, and furnish pretexts
for their project of usurping the Thibetian government.&nbsp; If,
on our account, a rupture unhappily broke out between Lha-Ssa and
Peking, we should inevitably be held responsible for it; we
should become odious in the eyes of the Thibetians, and the
introduction of Christianity into these countries would be
encountered hereafter with greater difficulties than ever.&nbsp;
We therefore considered that it would be better to submit, and to
accept with resignation the crown of persecution.&nbsp; Our
conduct should prove to the <!-- page 209--><a
name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>Thibetians,
that at least we had come among them with peaceful intentions,
and that we did not intend to establish ourselves there by
violence.</p>
<p>Another consideration helped to confirm our resolution.&nbsp;
It occurred to us that this very tyranny which the Chinese
exercised against us, might perhaps be the ultimate occasion of
our missionaries establishing themselves in Thibet with
security.&nbsp; In our simplicity, we imagined that the French
government would not see with indifference this monstrous
assumption of China, in daring to persecute Christianity and the
French name even among foreign nations, and at a distance of more
than a thousand leagues from Peking.&nbsp; We were persuaded that
the representative of France at Canton could not omit to make
emphatic remonstrances to the Chinese authorities, and that he
would obtain just reparation for the violence with which we had
been treated.&nbsp; In thinking thus, we poor and obscure
missionaries were far from wishing to give ourselves, in our own
eyes, the least personal importance; but we do not disguise it,
we were proud in the belief that our position as Frenchmen would
be a sufficient title for our obtaining the protection of the
government of our country.</p>
<p>After having maturely considered these points, we proceeded to
the Regent.&nbsp; On learning that we had determined to leave
Lha-Ssa, he seemed sad and embarrassed.&nbsp; He told us he
greatly wished he had it in his power to secure for us a free and
tranquil abode in Thibet; but that alone, and without the support
of his sovereign, he had found himself too weak to resist the
tyranny of the Chinese, who for several years past, taking
advantage of the infancy of the Tal&eacute;-Lama, had assumed
unprecedented claims in the country.&nbsp; We thanked the Regent
for his goodwill, and left him to wait upon the Chinese
ambassador.</p>
<p>We told Ki-Chan that, at a distance from all protection, we
had resolved to leave Lha-Ssa, since he was determined to compel
us to do so; but that we protested against this violation of our
rights.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; answered Ki-Chan,
&ldquo;you cannot do better; you must depart; it will be better
for you, better for the Thibetians, better for me, better for
everybody.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then told us that he had ordered all
preparations to be made for our departure; that the Mandarin and
escort who were to accompany us, had been selected.&nbsp; It had
even been arranged that we should depart in eight days, and that
they should take us along the route which leads to the frontiers
of China.&nbsp; This last arrangement, excited at once our
indignation and surprise; it was inconceivable how they could
have the cruelty to condemn us to a journey of eight months,
whilst by proceeding towards India twenty-five days&rsquo; march
would suffice to <!-- page 210--><a name="page210"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 210</span>carry us to the first European
station, whence we could not fail to find means, both secure and
easy, for reaching Calcutta.&nbsp; We forthwith and vehemently
protested against the project, but our protest was disregarded,
as was the request for some few additional days rest, after the
long journey we had just made, and to give time for the closing
of the great wounds caused by the cold of the desert.&nbsp; All
we could say to mollify the cruelty of the Chinese ambassador was
unavailing.</p>
<p>We then laid aside our suppliant tone, and declared to the
delegate of the court of Peking, that we yielded to violence, but
that we would denounce to our government: first, that the Chinese
ambassador, installed at Lha-Ssa, had arbitrarily and violently
driven us thence, under the vain pretext that we were strangers
and preachers of the Christian religion, which he called wicked
and repudiated by his Emperor.&nbsp; In the second place, that in
opposition to all right and all justice, he had prevented us from
pursuing an easy and direct route, of only twenty-five
days&rsquo; journey, to drag us tyrannically into the interior of
China, and make us undergo the hardships of an eight
months&rsquo; journey.&nbsp; Finally, that we would denounce to
our government the barbarity with which they forced us to set
out, without allowing us a little rest, a barbarity which, in our
then state, we had a right to consider as an attempt upon our
life.&nbsp; Ki-Chan replied that he had nothing to do with what
the French government might think or do, that in his conduct he
had only to regard the will of his Emperor.&nbsp; &ldquo;If my
master,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;knew that I had permitted two
Europeans freely to preach the religion of the Lord of heaven in
Thibet, I should be lost.&nbsp; It would not be possible for me
to escape death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day, Ki-Chan sent for us in order to communicate to
us a report he had drawn up on the subject of our affairs; and
which he proposed to lay before the Emperor.&nbsp; &ldquo;I did
not wish,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to let it go without reading it
to you previously, for fear there should have escaped me in it
any expressions inexact in themselves or distasteful to
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Having attained his chief object, Ki-Chan had
resumed his amiable and conciliatory manner towards us.&nbsp; His
report was unmeaning enough; what it said about us was neither
good nor bad; it simply set forth a dry nomenclature of the
countries we had passed through, since our departure from
Macao.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is this report as you like it?&rdquo; said
Ki-Chan; &ldquo;do you see anything in it to alter?&rdquo;&nbsp;
M. Huc answered, that he had an observation to make of great
importance.&nbsp; &ldquo;Speak, I listen.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;What I have to say to you, does not interest us in the
least; but it affects you very nearly.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us
hear what it is.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;My communication must be
private: let your people withdraw.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;These men
are my <!-- page 211--><a name="page211"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 211</span>servants; they all belong to my
household; fear nothing.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, it is not we who
have anything to fear; all the danger is to you.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;The danger to me!&nbsp; No matter, the officers of my
suite may hear all.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;If you will, you can
repeat to them what I have to say; but I cannot speak in their
presence.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Mandarins cannot hold secret
conversations with strangers; it is forbidden by the
laws.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;In that case, I have nothing to tell
you; send the report just as it is; but if it brings misfortune
upon you, only blame yourself.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Chinese
ambassador became pensive; he took infinite pinches of snuff, one
after another, and then, as the result of long reflection, told
his suite to retire, and to leave us alone with him.</p>
<p>When everyone had gone, M. Huc began: &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said
he to Ki-Chan, &ldquo;you will understand why I wished to speak
to you in private, and how important it is to you that no one
should hear what I have to tell you.&nbsp; You will judge if we
are dangerous men, we who fear even to injure our
persecutors.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ki-Chan was pale and
disconcerted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us hear,&rdquo; said he;
&ldquo;explain yourself&mdash;let your words be candid and clear;
what would you say?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;In your report, there is
an inexactitude; you make me set out from Macao with my brother
Joseph Gabet, and yet I did not enter China till four years after
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, if that is all, it is easy to
correct it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, very easy.&nbsp; This
report, you say, is for your Emperor; is it not so?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;In that case, it is your
duty to tell the Emperor the truth and nothing but the
truth.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, nothing but the truth; let us
correct the report.&nbsp; At what period did you enter
China?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;In the twentieth year of Tao-Kouang
(1840).&rdquo;&nbsp; Ki-Chan took his pencil and wrote in the
margin&mdash;twentieth year of Tao-Kouang.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
moon?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The second moon.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ki-Chan
hearing us speak of the second moon, laid down his pencil and
looked at us with a fixed stare.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, I entered the
Chinese empire in the twentieth year of Tao-Kouang, in the second
moon; I passed through the province of Canton, of which you were
at that time viceroy.&nbsp; Why do you not write? are you not to
tell all the truth to the Emperor?&rdquo;&nbsp; The face of
Ki-Chan contracted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you see now why I wished to
talk to you in private?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, I know the
Christians are good people&mdash;does anyone here know of this
matter?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, not anyone.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ki-Chan
took the report, tore it up; he wrote a fresh one, entirely
different from the first.&nbsp; The dates of our first entry into
China were not exactly set forth, and there was a pompous
eulogium on our knowledge and sanctity.&nbsp; The poor man had
been simple enough to believe that we attached a great importance
to his Emperor&rsquo;s good opinion of us.</p>
<p>In accordance with the orders of Ki-Chan, we were to set out
after the festivals of the Thibetian new year.&nbsp; We had only
been at <!-- page 212--><a name="page212"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 212</span>Lha-Ssa two months, and we had
already passed the new year twice, first the European new year,
and then the Chinese; it was now the turn of the Thibetian.&nbsp;
Although at Lha-Ssa, they reckon the year as in China, according
to the lunar system, yet the calendars of these two countries do
not agree: that of Lha-Ssa is always a month behind that of
Peking.&nbsp; It is known that the Chinese, the Mongols, and most
of the peoples of Eastern Asia, make use in their chronological
calculations of a sexagenary cycle, composed of ten signs called
trunks, and of twelve signs which bear the name of
branches.&nbsp; Among the Tartars and Thibetians, the signs of
the denary cycle are expressed by the names of the five elements
repeated twice, or by the names of the five colours with their
shades.&nbsp; The names of twelve animals denote the duodenary
cycle.</p>

<p>As this cycle returns periodically every sixty years, it may
be imagined that great confusion might occur in chronology, if
they had not a sure method of fixing the past sexagenary
cycles.&nbsp; To obviate this inconvenience, the sovereigns give
to each year of their reign a particular name, and by this means
the cyclic epochs are fixed in a way to leave no doubt.&nbsp;
Thus the Mongols say, &ldquo;The twenty-eighth year Tao-Kouang,
which is that of the fiery ram (1848.)&rdquo;&nbsp; In China, the
present sexagenary cycle commenced with the year 1805, and the
years Tao-Kouang date from 1820, the epoch when the Emperor now
reigning mounted the throne.&nbsp; It is to be observed that
Chun-Tchi, Khang-Hi, Young-Tching, Kien-Long, Kia-King,
Tao-Kouang, are not at all the names of the six first Emperors of
the Mantchou dynasty, but special denominations to denote the
years of their reign.</p>
<p>The Thibetians have adopted the use of the denary and
duodenary cycles.&nbsp; But by making them undergo more numerous
combinations than the Mongols, they obtain a cycle of 252
years.&nbsp; The twelve first years merely bear the names of
twelve animals; then these same names are combined with those of
the five elements, repeated twice up to the 72nd year of the
cycle.&nbsp; They then add to these combinations the word
<i>po</i> (male), which carries them up to the 132nd year; then
the word <i>mo</i> (female), which takes it up to the 192nd year;
finally, they alternate the words <i>po</i> and <i>mo</i> to the
end of the cycle.</p>
<p>This chronological system, too complicated for the use of the
lower classes, is confined to the Lamaseries, where it is studied
and <!-- page 215--><a name="page215"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 215</span>understood by the more learned
Lamas.&nbsp; The masses live on from day to day, without an idea
even of the existence of this method of combining the
cycles.&nbsp; Except the Regent, we found no one at Lha-Ssa who
could tell us in what year we were.&nbsp; They seemed generally
to be wholly unaware of the importance of denoting dates and
years by particular names.&nbsp; One of the highest functionaries
of Lha-Ssa, a very celebrated Lama, told us that the Chinese
method of counting the years was very embarrassing, and not at
all comparable with the simplicity of the Thibetian method; he
thought it more natural to say plainly, this year, last year,
twenty or a hundred years ago, and so on.&nbsp; When we told him
that this method would only serve to make history an inextricable
confusion, &ldquo;Provided we know,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what
occurred in times gone by, that is the essential point.&nbsp;
What is the good of knowing the precise date of the
occurrences?&nbsp; Of what use is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This contempt, or rather this indifference for chronology, is
observable, in fact, in most of the Lamanesque works; they are
frequently without order or date, and merely present to the
reader a hotch-potch of anecdotes piled one on another, without
any precision, either about persons or events.&nbsp; Fortunately
the history of the Thibetians being continually mixed up with
that of the Chinese and the Tartars, one can apply the literature
of these latter peoples to the introduction of a little order and
precision into the Thibetian chronology.</p>
<p>During our stay at Lha-Ssa, we had occasion to remark that the
Thibetians are very bad chronologists, not only with respect to
leading dates, but even in the manner of reckoning each day the
age of the moon.&nbsp; Their almanac is in a state of truly
melancholy confusion, and this confusion entirely proceeds from
the superstitious ideas of the Buddhists respecting lucky and
unlucky days; all the days reputed unlucky, which occur in the
course of the moon, are omitted, and do not count.&nbsp; Thus,
for example, if the fifteenth day of the moon is a day of ill
omen, they count the fourteenth twice over, and pass on direct to
the sixteenth.&nbsp; Sometimes several days of ill-omen occur one
after the other; but that is of no consequence; they cut them all
off just the same, until they come to a lucky day.&nbsp; The
Thibetians do not seem to find the least inconvenience in such a
method.</p>
<p>The renewal of the year is, with the Thibetians, as with all
people, a season of festivals and rejoicings.&nbsp; The last days
of the twelfth moon are consecrated to the preparations for it;
people lay in supplies of tea, butter, tsamba, barley wine, and
some joints of beef and mutton.&nbsp; The holiday clothes are
taken from the wardrobes; they remove the dust under which the
furniture is generally <!-- page 216--><a
name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>hidden;
they furbish up, clean, sweep, and try, in a word, to introduce
into the interior of their houses a little order and
neatness.&nbsp; The thing only happening once a year, all the
households assume a new aspect; the domestic altars are the
objects of especial care; they repaint the old idols, and they
make, with fresh butter, pyramids, flowers, and various ornaments
designed to deck the little sanctuaries where the Buddhas of the
family reside.</p>
<p>The first Louk-So, or Rite of the Festival, commences at
midnight, so that every one sits up, impatiently awaiting this
mystical and solemn hour, which is to close the old year, and
open the course of the new.&nbsp; As we were not anxious to catch
the exact point of intersection which separates the two Thibetian
years, we went to sleep at our usual hour.&nbsp; We were in a
deep slumber, when we were suddenly awakened by the cries of joy
which issued from all sides, in all quarters of the town.&nbsp;
Bells, cymbals, marine conches, tambourines, and all the
instruments of Thibetian music, were set to work, and operated
the most frightful uproar imaginable; it seemed as though they
were receiving the new-born year with a charivari.&nbsp; We had
once a good mind to get up, to witness the happiness of the merry
inhabitants of Lha-Ssa, but the cold was so cutting that after
serious reflection, we opined that it would be better to remain
under our thick woollen coverlets, and to unite ourselves in
heart with the public felicity.&nbsp; Repeated knocks on the door
of our house, threatening to dash it into splinters, warned us
that we must renounce our project.&nbsp; After several excuses,
we were at last fain to leave our warm beds; we donned our
clothes, and the door being opened, some Thibetians of our
acquaintance rushed into our room, inviting us to the new
year&rsquo;s banquet.&nbsp; They all bore in their hands a small
vessel made of baked earth, in which floated on boiling water,
balls composed of honey and flour.&nbsp; One of these visitors
offered us a long silver needle, terminating in a hook, and
invited us to fish in his basin.&nbsp; At first, we sought to
excuse ourselves, objecting that we were not in the habit of
taking food during the night, but they entreated us in so
engaging a manner, they put out their tongues at us with so
friendly a grace, that we were obliged to resign ourselves to the
Louk-So.&nbsp; We each hooked a ball, which we then crushed
between our teeth to ascertain its flavour.&nbsp; We looked at
each other, making grimaces; however, for politeness sake, we had
to swallow the dose.&nbsp; If we could only have got off with
this first act of devotion! but the Louk-So was inexorable; the
numerous friends we had at Lha-Ssa succeeded each other almost
without interruption, and we had perforce to munch Thibetian
sweetmeats till daybreak.</p>
<p><!-- page 217--><a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
217</span>The second Louk-So also consists in making visits, but
with a different ceremony.&nbsp; As soon as the dawn appears, the
Thibetians walk through the streets of the town, carrying in one
hand a pot of buttered tea, and in the other a large gilt and
varnished plate, filled with tsamba, piled up in the form of a
pyramid, and surmounted by three ears of barley.&nbsp; On these
occasions, it is not allowed to pay visits without the tsamba and
the buttered tea.&nbsp; As soon as you have entered the house of
a person to whom you propose to wish a happy year, you first of
all make three prostrations before the domestic altar, which is
solemnly adorned and illuminated; then, after having burnt some
leaves of cedar, or other aromatic tree, in a large copper
censer, you offer to every one present a cup of tea, and hand the
plate, from which each takes a pinch of tsamba.&nbsp; The people
of the house reciprocate the compliment to the visitors.&nbsp;
The inhabitants of Lha-Ssa have a saying, the Thibetians
celebrate the festival of the new year with tsamba and buttered
tea; the Chinese with red paper and crackers; the Katchi with
delicate meats and tobacco; the Peboun with songs and sports.</p>
<p>Although this popular saying is correct enough, the Pebouns do
not altogether monopolize the gaiety of the period.&nbsp; The
Thibetians also enliven their new years&rsquo; f&ecirc;tes with
noisy rejoicings, in which the song and the dance always play a
large part.&nbsp; Groups of children, with numerous bells hung
from their green dresses, pervade the streets, giving, from house
to house, concerts that are not wanting in harmony.&nbsp; The
song, generally sweet and melancholy, is interspersed with
animated choruses.&nbsp; During the strophe, all these little
singers keep marking the time, by making, with their bodies, a
slow and regular movement like the swinging of a pendulum; but
when they come to the chorus, they vigorously stamp their feet on
the ground in exact time.&nbsp; The noise of the bells, and of
the nailed boots, produces a kind of wild accompaniment that
strikes upon the ear not disagreeably, especially when it is
heard at a certain distance.&nbsp; These youthful
<i>dilettanti</i> having performed their concert, it is usual
with those for whom they have sung to distribute among them cakes
fried in nut-oil, and some balls of butter.</p>
<p>On the principal squares, and in front of the public
monuments, you see, from morning till night, troops of comedians
and tumblers amusing the people with their representations.&nbsp;
The Thibetians have not, like the Chinese, collections of
theatrical pieces; their comedians remain altogether and
continuously on the stage, now singing and dancing, now
exhibiting feats of strength and agility.&nbsp; The ballet is the
exercise in which they seem to excel the most.&nbsp; <!-- page
218--><a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
218</span>They waltz, they bound, they tumble, they
<i>pirouette</i> with truly surprising agility.&nbsp; Their dress
consists of a cap, surmounted by long pheasants&rsquo; plumes, a
black mask adorned with a white beard of prodigious length, large
white pantaloons, and a green tunic coming down to the knees, and
bound round the waist by a yellow girdle.&nbsp; To this tunic are
attached, at equal distances, long cords, at the end of which are
thick tufts of white wool.&nbsp; When the actor balances himself
in time, these tufts gracefully accompany the movements of his
body; and when he whirls round they stick out horizontally, form
a wheel round the performer, and seem, as it were, to accelerate
the rapidity of his <i>pirouettes</i>.</p>
<p>You also see at Lha-Ssa a sort of gymnastic exercise called
the Dance of the Spirits.&nbsp; A long cord, made of leathern
straps, strongly plaited together, is attached to the top of the
Buddha-La, and descends to the foot of the mountain.&nbsp; The
dancing sprites go up and down this cord, with an agility only to
be compared with that of cats or monkeys.&nbsp; Sometimes, when
they have reached the top, they fling out their arms as if about
to swim, and let themselves slide down the rope with the velocity
of an arrow.&nbsp; The inhabitants of the province of Ssang are
reputed the most skilful in this kind of exercise.</p>
<p>The most singular thing we observed at Lha-Ssa, during the new
year&rsquo;s festival, is what the Thibetians call the
Lha-Ssa-Morou, that is, the total invasion of the town, and its
environs, by innumerable bands of Lamas.&nbsp; The Lha-Ssa-Morou
commences on the third day of the first moon.&nbsp; All the
Buddhist monasteries of the province of Oui open their doors to
their numerous inhabitants, and you see great bodies of Lamas, on
foot, on horseback, on asses, on oxen, and carrying their
prayer-books and cooking utensils, arriving tumultuously by all
the roads leading to Lha-Ssa.&nbsp; The town is soon overwhelmed
at all points, by these avalanches of Lamas, pouring from all the
surrounding mountains.&nbsp; Those who cannot get lodgings in
private houses, or in public edifices, encamp in the streets and
squares, or pitch their little travelling tents in the
country.&nbsp; The Lha-Ssa-Morou lasts six entire days.&nbsp;
During this time, the tribunals are closed, the ordinary course
of justice is suspended, the ministers and public functionaries
lose in some degree their authority, and all the power of the
government is abandoned to this formidable army of Buddhist
monks.&nbsp; There prevails in the town an inexpressible disorder
and confusion.&nbsp; The Lamas run through the streets in
disorderly bands, uttering frightful cries, chanting prayers,
pushing one another about, quarrelling, and sometimes having
furious contests with their fists.</p>
<p>Although the Lamas generally show little reserve or modesty
<!-- page 219--><a name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
219</span>during these festive days, it is not to be supposed
that they go to Lha-Ssa merely to indulge in amusements
incompatible with their religious character; it is devotion, on
the contrary, which is their chief motive.&nbsp; Their purpose is
to implore the blessing of the Tal&eacute;-Lama, and to make a
pilgrimage to the celebrated Buddhist monastery called Morou,
which occupies the centre of the town.&nbsp; Hence the name of
Lha-Ssa-Morou given to these six festive days.</p>
<p>The monastery of Morou is remarkable for the splendour and
wealth displayed in its temples.&nbsp; The order and neatness
which always prevail here, make it, as it were, the model and
example for the other monasteries of the province.&nbsp; West of
the principal temple, there is a vast garden surrounded by a
peristyle.&nbsp; In this is the printing establishment.&nbsp;
Numerous workmen, belonging to the Lamasery, are daily occupied
in engraving blocks, and printing Buddhist books.&nbsp; Their
process being the same as that of the Chinese, which is
sufficiently understood, we shall dispense with describing
it.&nbsp; The Lamas who pay their annual visit to the festival of
the Lha-Ssa-Morou, take the opportunity to purchase the books
they require.</p>
<p>In the district of Lha-Ssa alone, they reckon more than thirty
large Buddhist monasteries. <a name="citation219"></a><a
href="#footnote219" class="citation">[219]</a>&nbsp; Those of
Khaldhan, of Preboung and Sera, are the most celebrated and the
most populous.&nbsp; Each of them contains nearly 15,000
Lamas.</p>
<p>Khaldhan, which means in Thibetian &ldquo;celestial
beatitude,&rdquo; is the name of a mountain situated east of
Lha-Ssa about four leagues.&nbsp; It is on the summit of this
mountain that the Lamasery of Khaldhan stands.&nbsp; According to
the Lamanesque books, it was founded in the year 1409 of our era,
by the famous Tsong-Kaba, reformer of Buddhism, and founder of
the sect of the yellow cap.&nbsp; Tsong-Kaba fixed his residence
there, and it was there he quitted his human envelope, when his
soul was absorbed in the universal essence.&nbsp; The Thibetians
pretend that they still see his marvellous body there, fresh,
incorruptible, sometimes speaking, and, by a permanent prodigy,
always holding itself in the air without any support.&nbsp; We
have nothing to say about this belief of the Buddhists, because
the too short stay we made at Lha-Ssa did not permit us to visit
the monastery of Khaldhan.</p>
<p>The Lamasery of Preboung (ten thousand fruits) is situate two
leagues west of Lha-Ssa; it is built on the site of a lofty
mountain.&nbsp; In the centre of the monastery, rises a sort of
kiosk, magnificently ornamented, and all shining with gold and
paintings.&nbsp; It is reserved for the Tal&eacute;-Lama, who
repairs thither once a year, to <!-- page 220--><a
name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>explain to
the monks the contents of the sacred volumes.&nbsp; The Mongol
Lamas, who come to Thibet to perfect themselves in the science of
prayer, and to obtain the degrees of the Lamanesque hierarchy,
generally fix themselves at Preboung, which, on that account, is
sometimes called in the country a Monastery of the Mongols.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Sera is situated north of Lha-Ssa not more than half a league
from the town.&nbsp; The Buddhist temples and the residences of
the Lamas, stand on the slope of a mountain planted with hollies
and cypresses.&nbsp; The road followed by the pilgrims who come
from Tartary, passes by these houses.&nbsp; At a distance, these
monuments, ranged in the form of an amphitheatre one above the
other, and standing out upon the green base of the mountain,
present an attractive and picturesque sight.&nbsp; Here and
there, in the breaks of the mountain, and quite above the
religious city, you see a great number of cells inhabited by
contemplative Lamas, and which you can only reach with great
difficulty.&nbsp; The monastery of Sera is remarkable for three
large temples of several stories high, all the rooms of which are
entirely gilt.&nbsp; Hence it is that the Lamasery has acquired
the name of Sera, from the Thibetian word <i>ser</i>, which
signifies gold.&nbsp; In the chief of these three temples, they
religiously preserve the famous tortch&eacute;, or sanctifying
instrument, which, in the belief of the Buddhists, came from
India through the air, to place itself, if its own accord, in the
monastery of Sera.&nbsp; This instrument is of bronze, in form
resembling a pestle; the middle, by <!-- page 221--><a
name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>which you
hold it, is in one piece, and cylindrical; the two extremities
swell out in oval form, and are covered with symbolical
figures.&nbsp; Every Lama must possess a small
<i>tortch&eacute;</i>, made on the model of that which
marvellously came from India.&nbsp; When they repeat their
prayers, and during the religious ceremonies, this instrument is
indispensable to them: they must sometimes hold it, sometimes lay
it on their knees; then take hold of it again, and turn it in
their hand, according to the rules of the ritual.&nbsp; The
<i>tortch&eacute;</i> of Sera is the object of great
veneration.&nbsp; The pilgrims never fail to go and prostrate
themselves before the niche, wherever it lies.&nbsp; At the new
year&rsquo;s festival, it is carried in procession, with great
pomp, to Lha-Ssa, to be presented to the adoration of the people
of the town.</p>
<p>While the innumerable Lamas of Lha-Ssa-Morou were celebrating
with transport their noisy festival, we, our hearts oppressed
with sorrow, were occupied in the preparation for
departure.&nbsp; We took down the little chapel wherein we had
tasted such sweet, but alas, too short, consolation.&nbsp; After
having essayed to plough and sow a poor little corner of this
immense desert, we were obliged to abandon it, saying to
ourselves that shortly, no doubt, the briar and the thorn would
spring forth in abundance, and suffocate those precious germs of
salvation, which were already beginning to grow.&nbsp; Oh, how
bitter and depressing were these thoughts!&nbsp; We felt our
hearts breaking, and we had only strength enough to supplicate
the Lord to send, to these poor children of darkness,
missionaries more worthy of bearing to them the light of the
faith.</p>
<p>The evening before our departure, one of the secretaries of
the Regent entered our lodging, and presented to us, in his name,
two great ingots of silver.&nbsp; This attention on the part of
the first kalon affected us deeply, but we considered we ought
not to accept this sum.&nbsp; In the evening, on going to his
palace to bid him adieu, we took back to him the two
ingots.&nbsp; We laid them before him on a small table,
protesting to him that this proceeding resulted from no
ill-feeling on our part; that, on the contrary, we should always
remember, with gratitude, the good treatment we had received from
the Thibetian government, during the short stay we had made at
Lha-Ssa; that we had no hesitation in expressing our belief that
if it had depended on the Regent, we should throughout have
enjoyed in Thibet, the most tranquil and honourable repose; but
that, as to this money, we could not receive it without
compromising our conscience as missionaries and the honour of our
nation.&nbsp; The Regent did not seem in any degree irritated by
this proceeding.&nbsp; He told us that he understood our conduct,
and could appreciate the <!-- page 222--><a
name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>objection
we had expressed; that he would not insist on our accepting this
money, but that still he should be very glad to make us some
present upon separating.&nbsp; Then pointing to a dictionary in
four languages, which he had often observed us turning over with
interest, he asked us if this work would be agreeable to
us.&nbsp; We thought we might receive this present without
compromising in any way the dignity of our character, and we, on
our parts, expressed to the Regent how happy we should be if he
would deign to accept, as a reminiscence of France, the
microscope, which had so excited his curiosity; our offer was
kindly received.</p>
<p>At the moment of separation, the Regent rose and addressed to
us these words:&mdash;&ldquo;You are going away, but who can know
future events?&nbsp; You are men of astonishing courage.&nbsp;
Since you have been able to get thus far, I know you have in your
hearts a great and holy resolve.&nbsp; I think you will never
forget it; for my part, I shall always bear it in mind.&nbsp; You
understand me: circumstances will not permit me to say
more.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We understand,&rdquo; we replied to the
Regent, &ldquo;the full bearing of your words, and we will
implore our God to realize one day the purpose they
express.&rdquo;&nbsp; We then parted, our hearts bursting with
grief, from this man who had been so kind to us, and by whose
means we had formed the hope of making known, with God&rsquo;s
help, the truths of Christianity to these poor people of
Thibet.</p>
<p>When we re-entered our house, we found the Cashmerian governor
awaiting us; he had brought us some provision for our journey;
some excellent dried fruits from Ladak, cakes made of flour,
butter, and eggs.&nbsp; He insisted upon passing all the evening
with us, to assist us in packing our trunks.&nbsp; As he intended
shortly to visit Calcutta, we charged him to give intelligence of
us to the first Frenchman he should meet in the English
possessions in India.&nbsp; We also gave him a letter, which we
entreated him to get forwarded to the representative of the
French government at Calcutta.&nbsp; In this letter, we briefly
explained the circumstances of our stay in the capital of Thibet,
and the reasons of our departure.</p>
<p>It seemed to us advisable to take this measure, when we were
about to commence a journey of a thousand leagues, along
frightful roads continually bordered with precipices.&nbsp; We
thought that, if it should be the will of God for us to be buried
amid the mountains of Thibet, our friends in France would at
least know what had become of us.</p>
<p>The same evening, Samdadchiemba came to bid us adieu.&nbsp; On
the day that the Chinese ambassador had resolved to make us leave
Thibet, our dear neophyte had been taken from us.&nbsp; It is
needless to say how hard and painful this trial was; but to this
<!-- page 223--><a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
223</span>measure, we could not, either the Regent or ourselves,
offer any objection.&nbsp; Samdadchiemba was a native of the
province of Kan-Sou, directly subject to the Chinese
authority.&nbsp; Although our influence with Ki-Chan vas not very
great, yet we got him to promise that Samdadchiemba should suffer
no injurious treatment, and should be sent back safe to his
family.&nbsp; Ki-Chan promised this, and we have since
ascertained that he was true to his word.&nbsp; The Regent was
full of kindness towards our neophyte.&nbsp; As soon as he was
separated from us, he took care that he should want for nothing;
he even gave him a sum of money to provide for his journey.&nbsp;
With what circumstances allowed us to add to this, Samdadchiemba
was enabled to amass a small fortune, and to place himself in a
position to return in a fitting manner to his paternal
dwelling.&nbsp; We recommended him to go to his aged mother, and
fulfil the duties which filial affection dictates, to instruct
her in the mysteries of the Christian faith, and to cause her to
enjoy at her last moments the benefit of baptismal regeneration;
then, when he had closed her eyes, to return and pass his days
among the Christians.</p>
<p>To say the truth, Samdadchiemba was not an amiable young man;
sour, savage, and sometimes saucy, he was by no means an
agreeable fellow-traveller; yet he had in him a groundwork of
honesty and devotion, quite capable, in our opinion, of
compensating for the perversities of his nature.&nbsp; We felt at
parting from him a deep affliction, and all the more so, that we
had never suspected the existence, at the bottom of our hearts,
of so strong an attachment to this young man.&nbsp; But we had
made together a long and painful journey; we had endured together
so many privations, and so much misery, that, unconsciously, our
existence was, so to speak, fused with his.&nbsp; The law of
affinity which unites men to each other, acts with much more
power amidst suffering, than in prosperity.</p>
<p>On the day appointed for our departure, two Chinese soldiers
came, early in the morning, to inform us that the Ta-Lao-Ye,
Ly-Kouo-Ngan; that is to say, his Excellency Ly, pacificator of
kingdoms, awaited us at breakfast.&nbsp; This personage was the
Mandarin whom the ambassador Ki-Chan had appointed to accompany
us to China.&nbsp; We fulfilled his invitation; and, as the
departure was to take place from his house, we had our luggage
transported thither.</p>
<p>Ly, the pacificator of kingdoms, was a native of
Tchang-Tou-Fou, capital of the province of Sse-Tchouen; he
belonged to the hierarchy of the military mandarins.&nbsp; For
twelve years he had served in Gorkha, a province of Boutan, where
he obtained rapid promotion, and reaching the dignity of Tou-Sse,
with the general <!-- page 224--><a name="page224"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 224</span>command of the troops guarding the
frontiers bordering on the English possessions, he was decorated
with the blue button, and enjoyed the privilege of wearing in his
cap seven sable tails.&nbsp; Ly-Kouo-Ngan was only forty-five
years old, but you would have taken him for seventy; so broken
and battered was he; he had hardly any teeth left in his head;
his scanty hair was grey; his dull and glassy eyes endured a
strong light with difficulty; his flabby wrinkled face, his
totally withered hands, and his enormous legs, upon which he
could scarcely support his frame, all bespoke a man exhausted by
great excesses.&nbsp; We thought at first that this premature
senility resulted from an immoderate use of opium, but he
informed us himself, in our very first conversation, that it was
brandy which had reduced him to this state.&nbsp; Having obtained
permission to quit the service, he was now about to seek, in the
bosom of his family, and by a careful and severe diet, the
restoration of his shattered health.&nbsp; The ambassador Ki-Chan
had in fact hurried our departure in order that we might go in
company with this Mandarin, who in his quality of Tou-Sse, was
entitled to an escort of fifteen soldiers.</p>
<p>Ly-Kouo-Ngan was very well instructed for a military Mandarin;
the knowledge he had of the Chinese literature, and above all,
his eminently observant character, rendered his conversation
effective and full of interest.&nbsp; He spoke slowly, almost in
a drawling manner, but he had the faculty of giving to his
stories and general conversation a dramatic and picturesque
turn.&nbsp; He was very fond of philosophical and religious
discussions; he had even, he said, magnificent projects of
perfection for the time, when quiet and unembarrassed in his
family, he should have nothing to do but to play at chess with
his friends, or go and see the play.&nbsp; He believed neither in
the Bonzes nor in the Lamas; as to the doctrine of the Lord of
Heaven, he scarcely knew what it was, and required to be
initiated in it before he embraced it.&nbsp; Meanwhile, all his
religion consisted in a fervent veneration for the Great
Bear.&nbsp; He affected aristocratic manners and exquisite
polish; unfortunately, he happened sometimes to forget himself,
and to expose his altogether plebeian origin.&nbsp; It is
superfluous to add that his excellency the pacificator of
kingdoms, was passionately fond of silver ingots; otherwise it
would have been difficult to recognise in him a Chinese, much
less a Mandarin.&nbsp; Ly-Kouo-Ngan had a luxurious breakfast
prepared for us; and his table seemed to us all the finer as for
two years we had been used to live almost like savages.&nbsp; The
habit of eating with our fingers had nearly made us forget the
use of the Chinese chop-sticks.&nbsp; When we had finished,
Ly-Kouo-Ngan informed us that everything was ready for departure,
but, <!-- page 225--><a name="page225"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 225</span>that before setting out, it was his
duty to go to the palace of the ambassador, with his company of
soldiers, to take leave.&nbsp; He asked us if we would not
accompany him.&nbsp; &ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; we replied,
&ldquo;let us go together to the residence of the ambassador; you
will fulfil your duty, and we a politeness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We entered, our guide and ourselves, the apartment where
Ki-Chan sat.&nbsp; The fifteen soldiers drew up in file at the
threshold of the door, after prostrating themselves thrice and
striking the earth with their foreheads.&nbsp; The pacificator of
kingdoms did the same, but the poor wretch could not himself get
up again without our assistance.&nbsp; According to our custom,
we saluted by placing our caps under our arms.&nbsp; Ki-Chan
opened the discourse, and addressed a short speech to each of
us.</p>
<p>Addressing us first, he assumed a wheedling tone:
&ldquo;You,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;are going to return to your
country; I do not think you have any complaint to make of me; my
conduct towards you has been irreproachable.&nbsp; I do not allow
you to stay here, but this is the will of the grand Emperor, not
mine.&nbsp; I do not suffer you to go to India, because the laws
of the empire forbid it; if it were otherwise, I, old as I am,
would accompany you myself to the frontiers.&nbsp; The road you
are about to travel is not so horrible as you are led to imagine;
you will have, it is true, a little snow, you will pass some high
mountains, and some of the days will be cold.&nbsp; You see I do
not conceal the truth from you.&nbsp; Why should I try to mislead
you? but at all events, you will have attendants to wait upon
you, and every evening you will have a lodging for the night
ready for you; you will have no need to put up a tent.&nbsp; Is
not this travelling better than that on your way hither?&nbsp;
You will be obliged to travel on horseback; I cannot give you a
palanquin; there are none to be got in this country.&nbsp; The
report I am going to address to the grand Emperor will be sent in
a few days.&nbsp; As my couriers go day and night they will pass
you.&nbsp; When you have reached in safety the capital of
Sse-Tchouen, the viceroy, Pao, will take charge of you, and my
responsibility will be at an end.&nbsp; You may depart in
confidence and with joyful hearts.&nbsp; I have sent on orders
that you shall be well treated throughout.&nbsp; May the star of
happiness guide you in your journey from beginning to
end.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Although we consider ourselves
oppressed,&rdquo; replied we to Ki-Chan, &ldquo;we do not the
less on that account offer up wishes for your prosperity.&nbsp;
Since it is to dignities you aspire, may you recover all those
you have lost, and attain still higher.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,
my star is unlucky! my star is unlucky!&rdquo; cried Ki-Chan,
taking a vigorous pinch of snuff from his silver box.</p>
<p><!-- page 226--><a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
226</span>Then addressing himself to the pacificator of kingdoms,
his voice assumed a grave and solemn tone,
&ldquo;Ly-Kouo-Ngan,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;since the grand
Emperor allows you to return to your family, you depart; you will
have these two fellow-travellers, and this circumstance ought to
cause you great joy, for the way, you know, is long and
tedious.&nbsp; The character of these men is full of justice and
gentleness; you will therefore live with them in perfect
harmony.&nbsp; Take care never to sadden their hearts, by word,
or deed.&nbsp; Another important thing I have still to say: As
you have served the empire for twelve years on the frontiers of
Gorkha, I have commanded the paymaster to send you 500 ounces of
silver; it is a present from the grand Emperor.&rdquo;&nbsp; At
these words Ly-Kouo-Ngan, finding all at once an unwonted
suppleness in his legs, threw himself on his knees with
vehemence: &ldquo;The heavenly beneficence of the great
Emperor,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;has always surrounded me on every
side, but unworthy servant that I am, how could I receive a
further signal favour without blushing?&nbsp; I address my
heartfelt supplications to the ambassador, that I may hide my
face from him, and withdraw myself from this undeserved
graciousness.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ki-Chan replied, &ldquo;Do you imagine
the grand Emperor will thank you for your
disinterestedness?&nbsp; What are a few ounces of silver?&nbsp;
Go, receive this small sum, as it is offered to you; it will
furnish you with tea to offer to your friends; but when you get
home, take care not to begin drinking brandy again.&nbsp; If you
wish to live a few years longer, you must deny yourself
brandy.&nbsp; I say to you this, because a Father and Mother
ought to give their children good advice.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Ly-Kouo-Ngan struck the earth thrice with his forehead, and then
rose up and placed himself beside us.&nbsp; Ki-Chan then
harangued the soldiers, and changed his tone for the third
time.&nbsp; His voice was sharp, abrupt, and sometimes bordering
on anger.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you soldiers!&rdquo; at these words
the fifteen soldiers, as though moved by one string, fell
together on their knees, and retained that position all the time
of the harangue.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me see, how many are there of
you?&nbsp; You are fifteen, I think,&rdquo; and at the same time
he counted them with his finger; &ldquo;yes, fifteen men; you,
fifteen soldiers, are about to return to your own province; your
service is fulfilled; you will escort your Tou-Sse to
Sse-Tchouen, as also these two strangers.&nbsp; On the way you
will serve them faithfully, and take care to be always respectful
and obedient.&nbsp; Do you clearly understand what I
say?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, we do.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;When you
pass through the villages of the <i>Poba</i> (Thibetians) beware
that you do not oppress the people.&nbsp; At the stations take
care not to rob or pillage the property of any person.&nbsp; Do
you clearly understand?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, we
do.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Do not injure the flocks, respect the
<!-- page 227--><a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
227</span>cultivated fields, do not set fire to the woods.&nbsp;
Do you clearly understand me?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, we
do.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Among yourselves let there always be
peace and harmony.&nbsp; Are you not all soldiers of the
empire?&nbsp; Do not then abuse or quarrel with one
another.&nbsp; Do you understand clearly?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, we do.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Whoever conducts himself
badly, let him not hope to escape chastisement; his crime will be
investigated attentively, and severely punished.&nbsp; Do you
clearly understand?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, we do.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;As you understand, obey and tremble.&rdquo;&nbsp; After
this brief but energetic peroration, the fifteen soldiers struck
the ground with their foreheads thrice and rose.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Just as we were leaving the residence of the ambassador,
Ki-Chan drew us apart, to say a few words in private.&nbsp;
&ldquo;In a little while,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I shall leave
Thibet, and return to China. <a name="citation227"></a><a
href="#footnote227" class="citation">[227]</a>&nbsp; In order
that I may not be too much encumbered with luggage, on my
departure, I am going to send two large cases with you; they are
covered with the hide of a long-haired ox.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then
told us the <!-- page 228--><a name="page228"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 228</span>characters with which they were
marked.&nbsp; &ldquo;These two cases,&rdquo; added he, &ldquo;I
recommend to your care.&nbsp; Every evening, when you reach the
station, have them deposited in the place where you yourselves
pass the night.&nbsp; At Tching-Tou-Fou, capital of Sse-Tchouen,
you will commit them to the care of Pao-Tchoung-Tang, viceroy of
the province.&nbsp; Keep a good eye on your own property, for in
the route you will pursue, there are many petty
thieves.&rdquo;&nbsp; Having assured Ki-Chan that we would
observe his recommendation, we rejoined Ly-Kouo-Ngan, who was
waiting for us on the threshold of the great entrance gate.</p>
<p>It was rather curious that the Chinese ambassador should think
fit to confide his treasure to us, whilst he had at his disposal
a Grand Mandarin, who was naturally called upon by his position
to render him this service.&nbsp; But the jealousy which Ki-Chan
felt towards strangers did not make him forget his own
interests.&nbsp; He considered, no doubt, that it would be more
safe to trust his cases to missionaries than to a Chinese, even
though the Chinese was a Mandarin.&nbsp; This token of confidence
gave us great pleasure.&nbsp; It was a homage rendered to the
probity of Christians, and, at the same time, a bitter satire
upon the Chinese character.</p>
<p>We proceeded to the house of Ly-Kouo-Ngan, where eighteen
horses, ready saddled, were awaiting us in the court-yard.&nbsp;
The three best were standing apart, reserved for the Tou-Sse and
ourselves.&nbsp; The fifteen others were for the soldiers, and
each was to take the one which fell to him by lot.</p>
<p>Before we mounted, a strong-limbed Thibetian female, very
fairly dressed, presented herself: she was the wife of
Ly-Kouo-Ngan.&nbsp; He had been married to her six years, and was
about to leave her for ever; he only had one child by her, which
had died in its infancy.&nbsp; As these two conjugal halves were
never again to see each other, it was but natural that at the
moment of so afflicting a separation, there should be a few words
of adieu.&nbsp; The thing was publicly done, and in the following
manner: &ldquo;We are going to part,&rdquo; said the husband,
&ldquo;do you stay here and sit quietly in your
room.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Go in peace,&rdquo; replied the wife,
&ldquo;go hence in peace, and take care of the swellings in your
legs.&rdquo;&nbsp; She then put her hand before her eyes, to make
believe she was crying.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said the
pacificator of kingdoms, turning to us, &ldquo;they are odd
people these Thibetian women.&nbsp; I leave her a well-built
house, and plenty of furniture almost new, and yet she is going
to cry&mdash;is she not content?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this adieu, so full of unction and tenderness, every one
mounted, and the party set out down the streets of Lha-Ssa,
taking care to select those less encumbered with Lamas.</p>
<p><!-- page 229--><a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
229</span>When we were out of the town, we perceived a large
group awaiting us.&nbsp; They were those inhabitants of Lha-Ssa,
with whom we had had more intimate acquaintance, during our stay
in that town.&nbsp; Many of them had begun to learn the truths of
Christianity, and seemed to us sincerely disposed to embrace our
holy religion; they had assembled on our road to salute us and
offer us a farewell khata.&nbsp; We observed, amongst them, the
young physician, still wearing on his breast the cross we had
given him.&nbsp; We dismounted, 
<a href="images/p229.jpg">
<img class='clearcenter' alt=
"Parting of Ly-Kouo-Ngan with his wife"
title=
"Parting of Ly-Kouo-Ngan with his wife"
src="images/p229.jpg" />
</a> and addressed to these Christian hearts a few words of
consolation; we exhorted them courageously to renounce the
superstitious worship of Buddha, to adore the God of the
Christians, and ever to have full trust in his infinite
mercy.&nbsp; Oh, how cruel was that moment, when we were obliged
to part from these well-beloved Catechumens, to whom we had as
yet only pointed out the path of eternal salvation without being
able to guide their first steps!&nbsp; Alas! we could do nothing
further for them, except to implore <!-- page 230--><a
name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>Divine
Providence to have compassion on these souls redeemed by the
blood of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>As we were remounting, we saw a horseman advancing towards us
at full gallop.&nbsp; It was the governor of the Cashmerians, who
had resolved to accompany us as far as the river Bo-Tchou.&nbsp;
We were extremely touched by so friendly an attention, which,
however, did not surprise us at all on the part of a sincere and
devoted friend, who had given us repeated proofs of his
attachment during our stay at Lha-Ssa.</p>
<p>The arrival of the governor of the Cashmerians occasioned us
to ride on slowly, for we had much to say.&nbsp; At length, after
an hour&rsquo;s march, we reached the borders of the
Bo-Tchou.&nbsp; We found there a Thibetian escort, which the
Regent had ordered to conduct us to the frontiers of China; it
was composed of seven men and a Grand Lama, bearing the title of
<i>Dheba</i> (governor of a district).&nbsp; With the Chinese
escort, we formed a caravan of twenty-six horsemen, without
counting the drivers of a large herd of oxen that carried our
baggage.</p>
<p>Two large ferry-boats were ready to receive the horsemen and
the horses; the latter jumped in at a single bound, and drew up
in a line, one beside the other.&nbsp; It was easy to see this
was not the first time they had performed this
man&oelig;uvre.&nbsp; The men then entered, with the exception of
the Dheba, Ly-Kouo-Ngan, and ourselves.&nbsp; We saw that they
were going to convey us across the river in a rather more
aristocratic manner; we looked in every direction, but saw no
means of transit.&nbsp; &ldquo;How, then, are we to go
over?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Look below there,&rdquo; they replied,
&ldquo;see the boat coming.&rdquo;&nbsp; We turned our eyes in
the direction indicated, and we perceived, in fact, a boat and a
man coming across the fields, but, contrary to the usual
practice, it was the boat that was carried by the man, and not
the man by the boat.&nbsp; This boatman, running with his back
laden with a large boat, was a thing monstrous to behold.&nbsp;
As soon as he reached the river side, he quietly set down his
load, and pushed the boat into the water without the least
effort.&nbsp; It was clearly one thing or the other: either the
man was of prodigious strength, or the boat of extreme
lightness.&nbsp; We looked at the man, and saw nothing
extraordinary in him; we approached the boat, examined it,
touched it, and the problem was solved.&nbsp; This large boat was
made of ox hide solidly sewn together; inside, a few light bamboo
sticks served to keep it in shape.</p>
<p>After having heartily shaken hands with the Cashmerian
governor, we entered the boat, but we nearly burst it the first
step we made.&nbsp; They had forgotten to tell us that we must
only tread on the bamboo rods.&nbsp; When we were all embarked,
the boatman <!-- page 231--><a name="page231"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 231</span>pushed off with a long pole, and in
the twinkling of an eye we were on the other side of the river;
we sprang ashore, and the owner taking the boat on his back, went
off across the fields.</p>
<p>These hide boats have the disadvantage of not remaining long
in the water without rotting.&nbsp; Each time they are done with,
the boatmen take care to turn them upside down on the beach, to
let them dry.&nbsp; Perhaps by varnishing them well, they might
be preserved from the action of the water, and rendered capable
of enduring a longer navigation.</p>
<p>When we were mounted, we cast a last look on the town of
Lha-Ssa, still visible in the distance, and said in our hearts:
&ldquo;Oh, my God, thy will be done!&rdquo; and followed in
silence the progress of the caravan.&nbsp; It was the 15th of
March, 1846.</p>

<p>Leaving Lha-Ssa we travelled for several days, amid a large
valley entirely cultivated, and where we remarked on every side
numerous <!-- page 233--><a name="page233"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 233</span>Thibetian farms, generally
surrounded by trees.&nbsp; The labours of agriculture had not yet
commenced, for in Thibet the winters are always long and
severe.&nbsp; Herds of goats and bellowing oxen were wandering
dejectedly about the dusty fields, biting every now and then at
the hard roots of the tsing-kou, with which the ground was
covered; this species of barley is the chief culture of these
poor regions.</p>
<p>The entire valley is composed of a number of small fields,
separated from one another by thick low fences, made of large
stones.&nbsp; The clearing of this stony ground doubtless costs
the original cultivators much fatigue.&nbsp; These enormous
stones had to be dug out of the ground one after the other, and
rolled with labour to the borders of the fields.</p>
<p>At the time of our passing, the country presented a dull and
melancholy aspect.&nbsp; The landscape, however, was animated at
intervals by caravans of Lamas, who, singing and dancing, were
going to the solemn festival of the Lha-Ssa-Morou.&nbsp; Shouts
of joy and laughter issued now and then from the farmhouses on
the roadside, and informed us that the rejoicings for the new
year were not yet at an end.</p>
<p>Our first stage was a short one.&nbsp; We stopped some time
before sunset, at Detsin-Dzoug, a large village, six leagues (60
lis) distant from Lha-Ssa.</p>
<p>A large house had been previously got ready for the
accommodation of the caravan.&nbsp; As soon as we had alighted,
we were introduced, by the governor of the village to a room, in
the midst of which flamed a magnificent fire of argols, in a
large earthen basin.&nbsp; We were invited to seat ourselves on
thick cushions of green Pou-Lou, and we were served immediately
with buttered tea.&nbsp; We were, in fact, surrounded by such
care and attention, that our hearts began to open.&nbsp; This
kind of travelling seemed marvellous to us.&nbsp; What a contrast
to the hard and laborious life we had spent in the desert, where
a halt was only an aggravation of misery to us.&nbsp; To travel
without being obliged to pitch a tent and to see to the animals;
without being put to any straits for fuel and food, seemed the
realization of a brilliant utopia.&nbsp; As soon as we
dismounted, to find a warm room, and a large pitcher of buttered
tea, was for us absolute sybaritism.</p>
<p>Soon after our arrival we received the official visit of the
Grand Lama, whom the Regent had appointed to accompany us to the
frontiers of China, and with whom we had as yet merely exchanged
a few compliments as we crossed the river.&nbsp; This individual
called Dsiamdchang, that is to say, the musician, was a thick-set
man, about 60 years of age, who had fulfilled administrative
functions <!-- page 234--><a name="page234"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 234</span>in several parts of Thibet.&nbsp;
Before being recalled to Lha-Ssa, he occupied the post of
Dheba-general, in a district some little distance from Ladak; his
large and somewhat wrinkled countenance was full of good
nature.&nbsp; His character partook of the frankness and open
disposition of a child.&nbsp; He told us that the Regent had
commanded him to come here expressly on our account, that he
might see we wanted nothing, during the time we were in the
regions subject to the Tal&eacute;-Lama.&nbsp; He then presented
to us two young Thibetians, on whom he pronounced a long and
pompous eulogium.&nbsp; &ldquo;These two men,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;have been specially appointed to serve you on the
way.&nbsp; Whatever you command them to do, that they must do
punctually.&nbsp; As to your refreshments,&rdquo; added he,
&ldquo;as you are not accustomed to the Thibetian cookery, it has
been arranged that you shall take them with the Chinese
Mandarin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a brief conversation with the Lama Dsiamdchang, we had,
<!-- page 235--><a name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
235</span>in fact, the honour to sup in the company of Ly, the
pacificator of kingdoms, who lodged in a chamber contiguous to
our own.&nbsp; Ly-Kouo-Ngan was very complaisant, and gave us a
great deal of information about the route we were to pursue, and
which he himself was now travelling for the eighth time.&nbsp;
That we might be enabled to have every day correct notions of the
countries through which we were passing, he lent us a Chinese
work, containing an itinerary from Tching-Tou, the capital of
Sse-Tchouen to Lha-Ssa.&nbsp; This book is entitled,
&ldquo;Oui-Tsang-Thou-Tchi,&rdquo; that is to say, &ldquo;A
description of Thibet, with engravings.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
compilation, from various Chinese notices of Thibet, was drawn up
by a Mandarin named Lou-Houa-Tchou, who, in the 51st year of
Kien-Long (1786), was charged with the commissariat of the
Chinese army.&nbsp; Father Hyacinthe, the Russian archimandrite
at Peking, published a translation of this sort of geography of
Thibet.&nbsp; M. Klaproth, after having revised, corrected, and
enriched with notes, the work of the Russian translator, inserted
it in the <i>Journal Asiatique</i>. <a name="citation235"></a><a
href="#footnote235" class="citation">[235]</a>&nbsp; The portion
of this Chinese work which concerns the route from Lha-Ssa to the
province of Sse-Tchouen, and which we had daily before us during
our journey, is extraordinarily exact; but this dry and laconic
itinerary can be of no interest except to persons occupying
themselves specially with geography, or who travel through the
places it mentions.&nbsp; It is merely an arid nomenclature,
stage by stage, of the places you find on the way.&nbsp; To give
an idea of it, we will transcribe the article relative to our
first day&rsquo;s journey.</p>

<p>We set out from Detsin-Dzoug before daybreak, for we had a
long way to go.&nbsp; We followed the same valley we had entered,
on <!-- page 236--><a name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
236</span>quitting the town of Lha-Ssa.&nbsp; But as we advanced,
the mountains, with which this large plain is surrounded, rose
insensibly in the horizon, and seemed to draw near us; the valley
grew narrower and narrower; the ground became more and more
stony; the farms less frequent; and the population lost by
degrees that appearance of refinement and civilization which is
always observable in the environs of large towns.&nbsp; After a
rapid and uninterrupted march of 80 lis we stopped to take a
little repose and refreshment in a large and ruinous Buddhist
convent, which served as a residence for some old ragged
Lamas.&nbsp; The poverty in which they lived rendered them unable
to offer to the staff of the caravan anything but tea with milk,
a pot of beer, and a small roll of butter.&nbsp; However, by
adding to these provisions, some biscuit and a leg of mutton
which the cook of Ly-Kouo-Ngan had been civil enough to prepare
for us on the previous evening, we realized a sufficiently
substantial repast.</p>
<p>As soon as we had satisfied our appetite and refreshed our
limbs, we thanked these poor religious Buddhists with a khata, or
scarf of blessings, and then remounted our horses.&nbsp; It was
already late, and we had yet 40 lis to go before we reached our
night stage.&nbsp; It was pitch-dark when we arrived at
Midchoukoung.&nbsp; Our first care was to summon our Thibetian
grooms, and bid them get ready our beds as soon as
possible.&nbsp; We considered that after a long journey on a bad
horse, we might dispense with ceremony.&nbsp; After partaking of
a light repast, and saying our prayers, we wished a good night to
the Pacificator of Kingdoms, and to the Lama musician, and
proceeded to bury ourselves under the coverlid.</p>
<p>Next day, when we put our heads out of bed, the sun was
already shining in all its splendour, yet all was quiet in the
courtyard of the inn; we could hear neither the bellowing of the
yaks, nor the neighing of the horses, nor anything indicating
preparations for the departure of a caravan.&nbsp; We rose, and
after rubbing our eyes, opened the door of our room to see how
matters stood.&nbsp; We found Ly-Kouo-Ngan and the Lama
Dsiamdchang, seated in a corner of the court-yard, quietly
basking in the rays of the sun.&nbsp; As soon as they saw us they
approached, and told us in an infinitely roundabout manner, that
we should be obliged to halt for one day, as there were
difficulties in procuring horses and a change of oxen.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This is very bad news,&rdquo; said they; &ldquo;this
mischance is very unfortunate, but we cannot help it; the
circumstance of the new-year&rsquo;s festival is the sole cause
of this delay.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; said
we, &ldquo;this is excellent news; we are in no sort of
hurry.&nbsp; Let us go quietly, and rest frequently on the way,
and all will go well.&rdquo;&nbsp; These words relieved our two
guides from a great <!-- page 237--><a name="page237"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 237</span>embarrassment.&nbsp; These good
people imagined that we should quarrel with them, because it was
necessary to make a day&rsquo;s halt; they were prodigiously
mistaken.&nbsp; If, in our previous travels, delays had been
sources of grievous vexation to us, the reason was that we had an
object in view, and that we were eager to attain it.&nbsp; But
now this was not the case, and we wished, as much as possible, to
travel like gentlemen.&nbsp; We felt, besides, that it was not
logical to go at a running pace from a place from which we had
been expelled.</p>
<p>Midchoukoung is a stage where you change your oulah, that is,
the horses, beasts of burden, and guides.&nbsp; These services
are kept up by the Thibetian government, all the way from Lha-Ssa
to the frontiers of China.&nbsp; The Chinese or Thibetian public
officers, who make official inspections of the roads, are alone
allowed to avail themselves of these sources.&nbsp; The
government of Lha-Ssa gives them a passport, upon which is stated
the number of men and animals that the villages, subject to the
contribution of the oulah, must furnish.</p>
<p>The Chinese account of Thibet gives the following account of
this compulsory service: &ldquo;As respects the local service
called oulah, all those who have any fortune, whether men or
women, are compelled to supply it; even those who come from the
most distant countries, if they occupy a house to themselves, are
not exempt from it.&nbsp; The number of men each person must
furnish for this service is regulated by the fortune of each
individual.&nbsp; The elders and the Dhebas determine, according
to the size of each house, the number of men, etc., it must
furnish to the oulah; each village provides three, four, and
sometimes as many as ten men.&nbsp; The smaller families employ
poor people as substitutes, paying them wages.&nbsp; People
beyond sixty years of age are exempt from the burden.&nbsp; If
the public service requires it, they exact oxen and horses, asses
and mules from the dwellings of the rich; the poor people club
together, and three or four houses give one beast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chinese Mandarins, who always try to make money out of
everything, find means to speculate in the oulah with which the
Thibetian government furnishes them.&nbsp; Before leaving
Lha-Ssa, they man&oelig;uvre, by all imaginable means, to have
set forth on their road-bill a great number of animals; they then
take as many as are actually necessary, and receive, instead of
the rest, a compensation in money, which the wealthy Thibetians
much prefer to give them than to expose their animals to the
perils of the road.&nbsp; Others claim the whole oulah, and
employ it to transport into China Thibetian merchandise.&nbsp;
Ly-Kouo-Ngan, whom we had heard declare so energetically his
disinterestedness, when the <!-- page 238--><a
name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>ambassador
Ki-Chan offered him a present on the part of the Emperor, showed
feelings much less generous in relation to the oulah.</p>
<p>During the day we passed at Midchoukoung, his road-bill
accidentally fell into our hands, and we were much surprised to
read there that we had been allotted two horses and twelve
long-haired oxen.&nbsp; Yet our entire baggage was two
portmanteaus and a few bed things.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do all these
oxen mean?&rdquo; inquired we of the Pacificator of Kingdoms;
&ldquo;do we need twelve beasts to carry two
portmanteaus?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s a mistake of the
secretary,&rdquo; replied he; and out of politeness, we affected
to be perfectly satisfied with the answer.</p>
<p>It often happens, however, that the Chinese make gross
mistakes as to their speculations in the oulah; they find, on the
way, for example, some Thibetian tribes who are not at all
disciplined to this kind of contribution.&nbsp; It is in vain
they point out to these rude and fierce mountaineers the
road-bill sealed with the seal of the Tal&eacute;-Lama and that
of the Chinese ambassador; they remain inexorable.&nbsp; To
everything that is said to them, as an inducement to submit to
the law, they have but this answer: &ldquo;For a guide you will
give so much; for a horse, so much; for a yak, so much;&rdquo;
until, at last, Chinese diplomacy is pushed into a corner, and
the oulah is paid.&nbsp; The inhabitants of the district of
Midchoukoung treated us with great politeness and courtesy: the
chiefs of the village had a spectacle got up for us, by a troop
of buffoons, who were assembled for the new year&rsquo;s
festival.&nbsp; The large courtyard of the inn, where we lodged,
served for a theatre: first, the artists, masked, and
fantastically dressed, performed for some time, wild, deafening
music, in order to summon to the play the inhabitants of the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; When all were come, and arranged in a circle
round the stage, the Dheba of Midchoukoung approached in a solemn
manner to offer to our two guides, and to ourselves, a scarf of
blessings, and invited us to take our places on four thick
cushions which had been placed at the foot of a large tree, that
rose from an angle of the court.&nbsp; As soon as we were seated,
all the troop of players put themselves in motion, and executed
to the sound of music a sort of satanic round, the rapidity of
which nearly made our heads swim; then came leaping, jumping,
pirouetting, feats of strength, combats with wooden sabres; the
whole accompanied alternately by songs, dialogues, music, and
imitations of the cries of wild beasts.&nbsp; Among this troop of
comedians, there was one more grotesquely masked than the others,
who acted as a sort of clown to the ring, monopolising the jests
and repartees.&nbsp; We had not knowledge enough of the Thibetian
<!-- page 239--><a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
239</span>language to appreciate his sallies; but judging from
the stamping of feet, and the shouts of laughter of the audience,
he seemed to acquit himself wonderfully as a wit.&nbsp;
Altogether, the exhibition was amusing enough; the Thibetians
were perfectly enthusiastic.&nbsp; When they had danced, leaped,
and sang for upwards of two hours, the performers ranged
themselves in a semicircle around us, took off their masks, and
put their tongues in their cheeks at us, with profound
bows.&nbsp; Each of us presented to the chief of the troop a
scarf of blessings, and the curtain fell.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, we invited Ly-Kouo-Ngan to a short
walk.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the indifferent elasticity possessed
by his legs, he acceded to our proposal with good grace, and we
proceeded together to explore the country.&nbsp; The village of
Midchoukoung is populous; but everything announces that its
inhabitants are living in anything but a state of comfort.&nbsp;
The houses are generally built of stones strongly cemented with
glazed earth; a great many are crumbling away, the ruins serving
as a retreat for troops of large rats.&nbsp; Some small Buddhist
altars, carefully lime-washed, are the only constructions that
exhibit any cleanliness, and their whiteness presents a
remarkable contrast with the grey, smoky hue of the
village.&nbsp; Midchoukoung has a Chinese guard, composed of four
soldiers and an under corporal.&nbsp; These men keep a few
horses, and their barracks serve as a stage for the couriers who
carry the dispatches of the Chinese government.</p>
<p>On re-entering the inn, we found in the courtyard, which in
the morning had been used as a theatre, a noisy assembly of men
and beasts.&nbsp; They were occupied in collecting our oulah,
which was settled at twenty-eight horses, seventy oxen, and
twelve guides.&nbsp; At the commencement of the night, the Dheba
came to inform us that all was done in accordance with the sacred
ordinance of the Tal&eacute;-Lama, and that on the morrow, we
could depart at an early or late hour as we pleased.&nbsp; At the
dawn of day, we mounted our horses, and bade adieu to
Midchoukoung.&nbsp; After some hours journey, we left, as through
the extremity of a large funnel, the great valley in which we had
been travelling since we left Lha-Ssa, and emerged into a wild
uncultivated region.&nbsp; For five days, we journeyed on in a
labyrinth, now to the right, now to the left, and sometimes
retracing our steps, in order to avoid abysses and inaccessible
mountains.&nbsp; We were perpetually in the depths of ravines, or
on the precipitous and rocky banks of torrents; our horses rather
leaped than walked.&nbsp; The most vigorous animals, not
accustomed to these dreadful places, could not resist for any
length of time the fatigues of such a route.&nbsp; For half a day
only could we travel with any pleasure and security.&nbsp; We
came again <!-- page 240--><a name="page240"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 240</span>to the river we had crossed on
quitting Lha-Ssa; it was tranquilly flowing over a slightly
inclined bed, and its broad banks offered an easy and even path
to travellers.&nbsp; Amid these wild regions, you find no place
wherein to pass the night, except cold, damp hovels, exposed to
all the winds of heaven.&nbsp; However, you arrive there so
overcome by fatigue, that you always sleep profoundly.</p>
<p>Before reaching the town of Ghiamda, we crossed the mountain
Loumma-Ri.&nbsp; &ldquo;This mountain,&rdquo; says the Chinese
itinerary, &ldquo;is high and somewhat declivitous; it extends
over a space of about forty lis.&nbsp; The snow, ice, and
menacing peaks which travellers meet with on the way, before
reaching this mountain, and which intimidate the heart and dim
the eye, may cause this to be regarded, in comparison, as a plain
easily traversed.&rdquo;&nbsp; The summit of Mount Loumma-Ri,
although very lofty, is, in fact, very easy of access.&nbsp; We
reached it by an easy slope, without being obliged to dismount
once, a very remarkable circumstance in the mountains of
Thibet.&nbsp; We found, however, on the other side of the
mountain a somewhat serious difficulty, on account of the snow,
which fell that day in abundance.&nbsp; The animals frequently
slipped, sometimes their hind feet came suddenly in contact with
their fore feet, but they never fell.&nbsp; The only result to
the horsemen was a sort of jerking swing, to which we grew
gradually accustomed.</p>
<p>The Pacificator of Kingdoms took it into his head to dismount,
and walk, to warm himself a little; but after a few stumbling
steps, he staggered for an instant on his poor legs, fell, and
made in the snow a broad, deep furrow.&nbsp; He rose in a fury,
ran to the nearest soldier, and loaded him with curses and cuts
of his whip, because he had not dismounted to support him.&nbsp;
All the Chinese soldiers immediately jumped from their steeds,
and fell at the feet of their colonel, making excuses.&nbsp; All,
in fact, had been deficient in their duty; for, according to the
Chinese code of politeness, when a chief sets his foot on the
ground, all the subalterns must on the instant dismount.</p>
<p>When we were at the base of the mountain of Loumma-Ri, we
continued our march along a little river, which meandered through
a forest of firs so thick that the light of day scarce penetrated
it; the snow lay deeply on the broad branches of the trees,
whence the wind shook them in thick flakes on the caravan.&nbsp;
These small avalanches, falling unexpectedly upon the horsemen,
made them start, and utter cries of surprise; but the animals,
which, doubtless, had crossed the forest before in similar
weather, were in no degree affected.&nbsp; They continued at
their ordinary pace, without taking fright, contenting themselves
with quietly shaking off the snow from their ears whenever it
incommoded them.</p>
<p><!-- page 241--><a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
241</span>We had scarcely emerged from the forest when we were
all obliged to dismount, for the purpose of scaling, during a
full hour, some horrible rocks.&nbsp; When we had reached the
summit, we laid the bridles on the necks of the horses, and left
the animals to the sagacity of their instinct as a guide over
this rapid and precipitous descent.&nbsp; The men descended, now
backwards, as down a ladder, now seated, and letting themselves
slide down the snow; every one extricated himself victoriously
from this dangerous position, and arrived at the bottom, without
breaking or bruising arms or legs.</p>
<p>We still went on five lis more, in a narrow valley, and then
perceived, at the foot of a high mountain, a large collection of
houses, amongst which rose two Buddhic temples of colossal
proportions.&nbsp; This was the station of Ghiamda.&nbsp; A
little before reaching the town, we found on the road, a company
of eighteen soldiers, drawn up in file, and having at their head
two petty Mandarins, decorated with the white button.&nbsp;
Mandarins and soldiers had their sabres drawn and their bows in
their shoulder-belts.&nbsp; It was the garrison of Ghiamda,
which, under arms and in full uniform, awaited Ly, the
pacificator of kingdoms, to pay him military honours.&nbsp; When
the caravan had come within proper proximity, the eighteen
soldiers and the two Mandarins fell on their knees, turning the
points of their sabres to the ground, and crying out with one
voice, &ldquo;To the Tou-Sse, Ly-Kouo-Ngan, the humble garrison
of Ghiamda wishes health and prosperity.&rdquo;&nbsp; At these
words, Ly-Kouo-Ngan, and the soldiers of his suite, stopped their
horses, dismounted, and ran to the garrison, to invite them to
rise.&nbsp; On both sides there was an infinity of bowing, during
which we quietly continued our journey.&nbsp; On entering the
town, we had, in our turn, our little official reception.&nbsp;
Two Thibetians, in holiday attire, seized, to do us honour, the
bridles of our horses, and conducted us to the house which had
been prepared for our reception.&nbsp; There the Dheba, or chief
magistrate of the district, awaited us; he offered us a scarf of
blessings, and led us into an apartment where was a table already
laid out with tea, butter, cakes, and dried fruits.&nbsp; In all
these marks of friendship and attention, we could not help
discerning the effect of orders forwarded by the Regent.&nbsp;
Whilst we were doing honour to this modest collation we were
informed that we should be obliged to stop two days at Ghiamda,
because the Dheba of the district, having received only that
morning the announcement of our approaching arrival, had not had
time to send for the animals, which were grazing, at a great
distance from the town.&nbsp; This news was very welcome to us;
but it plunged Ly-Kouo-Ngan and the Lama Dsiamdchang into
despair.&nbsp; We essayed <!-- page 242--><a
name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 242</span>to console
them, by telling them that when one cannot direct events, one
bears them with resignation.&nbsp; Our two conductors
acknowledged our doctrine to be very fine in theory, but the
practice was not to their taste.&nbsp; However, they were obliged
to admit afterwards, that this delay was very opportune, as,
during the two days that we remained at Ghiamda, the sky was so
overcast, the north wind blew with so much violence, and the snow
fell so abundantly, that, in the opinion of the Ghiamdians, we
could not have proceeded with safety in such boisterous
weather.&nbsp; In fact, judging from what passed in the valley,
it was easy to imagine that a frightful storm must have laid
waste the mountains.</p>
<p>The day after our arrival at Ghiamda we received a visit from
the two Chinese officers stationed in the town.&nbsp; The one
bore the title of Pa-Tsoung, and the other that of Wei-Wei.&nbsp;
The Pa-Tsoung was a fine man, strongly made, with a sounding
voice and quick movement.&nbsp; A large scar across his face, and
great black mustachios, contributed not a little to give him a
highly military look.&nbsp; For four years he had served in the
Kachkhar as a private soldier, and had returned thence with the
title of Pa-Tsoung and the decoration of the peacock&rsquo;s
feather.&nbsp; The Wei-Wei, a young man two-and-twenty, was also
a well-built person, but his languid and effeminate mien
presented a singular contrast with the manly bearing of his
colleague.&nbsp; His face was pale, flabby, and extremely
delicate, his eyes were constantly humid and languishing.&nbsp;
We asked him if he was ill.&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied he,
with a scarcely audible voice; &ldquo;my health is
excellent;&rdquo; and, as he spoke, his cheeks were slightly
tinged with an angry redness.&nbsp; We saw that we had been
guilty of an indiscretion, and we turned to another subject of
conversation.&nbsp; This poor young man was an insane smoker of
opium.&nbsp; When they were gone, Ly-Kouo-Ngan said, &ldquo;The
Pa-Tsoung is a man born under a very favourable star; he will
ascend rapidly the grades of the military mandarinship; but the
Wei-Wei was born under a cloud.&nbsp; Since he has become
addicted to the European smoke, heaven has forsaken him.&nbsp;
Before a year has elapsed he will have said good-by to the
world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The torrents of rain which fell almost without interruption
during our stay at Ghiamda, prevented us from visiting in detail
this populous and commercial town.&nbsp; You find a great number
of Pebouns or Indians of Boutan, who monopolise here, as at
Lha-Ssa, all that appertains to the arts and industry.&nbsp; The
agricultural products of the country are next to nothing.&nbsp;
They cultivate in the valley some black barley, but scarcely
sufficient for the consumption of the inhabitants.&nbsp; The
wealth of the district is derived from its wool and
goat&rsquo;s-hair, out of which they manufacture large <!-- page
243--><a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
243</span>quantities of stuffs.&nbsp; It appears that amid these
frightful hills, there are excellent pastures, where the
Thibetians feed numerous flocks.&nbsp; The lapis lazuli,
stag&rsquo;s horn, and rhubarb, are also materials of a great
commercial intercourse with Lha-Ssa and the provinces of
Sse-Tchouen and Yun-Nan.&nbsp; They affirm here, that it is in
the mountains about Ghiamda that the best rhubarb grows.&nbsp;
This district abounds in game of every description.&nbsp; The
forest, which we crossed after leaving Mount Loumma-Ri, was full
of partridges, pheasants, and several varieties of wild
fowl.&nbsp; The Thibetians have no idea how to make the best of
these meats, so admired by the gourmands of Europe.&nbsp; They
eat them boiled, and without any kind of seasoning.&nbsp; The
Chinese, in this respect, as in every other, are much more
advanced than their neighbours.&nbsp; The cook of Ly-Kouo-Ngan
dressed our venison in a manner that left us nothing to
desire.</p>
<p>The appointed day of departure having arrived, the oulah was
ready early in the morning.&nbsp; The wind had fallen, and the
rain had ceased, yet the weather was by no means fine; a cold and
thick fog enveloped the valley, and intercepted the view of the
surrounding mountains.&nbsp; We resolved, however, to proceed,
for the people of the place agreed in saying that, for the time
of year, the weather was all that could be expected.&nbsp;
&ldquo;So long as you are in the valley,&rdquo; they said,
&ldquo;you will not see very distinctly, but once on the heights,
the obscurity will disappear; as a general rule, whenever there
is a fog in the valley, snow is falling on the
mountains.&rdquo;&nbsp; These words were far from
encouraging.&nbsp; We were fain, however, to be resigned to our
position, fortifying ourselves against the snow, for every one
assured us that from Ghiamda to the frontiers of China, every
day, without a single exception, we should have it on our
road.&nbsp; Just as we were mounting, the Dheba of Ghiamda made
us a present of two pairs of spectacles to protect our eyes from
the dazzling whiteness of the snow.&nbsp; We could not, at first,
help laughing at the sight of these optical instruments, so
entirely novel to us was their form.</p>
<p>The place occupied by glass in ordinary spectacles, was here
occupied by a sort of gauze horsehair work, carved out like a
half walnut-shell.&nbsp; To fasten these two lids against the
eyes, there was on each side a string which passed behind the
ears, and was then tied under the chin.&nbsp; We thanked the
excellent Dheba most heartily; for, under the circumstances, the
present was inestimable.&nbsp; On crossing the mountain of
Loumma-Ri, we had already suffered much from the reflection of
the snow.</p>
<p>On quitting the town, we found, as on entering it, the
soldiers of the garrison awaiting Ly-Kouo-Ngan, in order to give
him the <!-- page 244--><a name="page244"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 244</span>military salute.&nbsp; These men,
ranged in file, in the fog, and holding in their hands a sabre
that gleamed in the obscurity, had so odd an appearance, that
almost all the horses in the caravan shied at them.&nbsp; These
military salutes were renewed, on the way, wherever there was a
Chinese garrison, to Ly-Kouo-Ngan&rsquo;s extreme
exasperation.&nbsp; As he was unable, on account of his diseased
legs, to dismount and remount with facility, these ceremonies
were a regular torment to him.&nbsp; It was in vain that at each
point he sent forward one of his soldiers to direct the garrison
not to come out to receive him.&nbsp; This made them only more
eager and more earnest for display, thinking that it was mere
modesty prompted him to withdraw himself from the honours due to
his rank.</p>
<p>Four lis from Ghiamda, we crossed a large and rapid torrent,
over a bridge composed of six enormous trunks of fir trees, not
planed, and so badly joined, that you felt them shake under your
feet.&nbsp; No one ventured to cross on horseback, and the
precaution was most valuable to one of our soldiers; his horse,
slipping over the wet and trembling bridge, one of its legs
passed between two trees, and stuck there as in a vice.&nbsp; If
the man had been on it, he would have inevitably been
precipitated into the torrent, and dashed to pieces on the
rocks.&nbsp; After long and painful efforts, we managed to
extricate the unfortunate animal from its frightful position; to
the astonishment of every one, it had not broken its leg, nor
even received the least wound.</p>
<p>Beyond this wretched bridge, we resumed our wild pilgrimage
across rugged and snow-clad mountains.&nbsp; For four days, we
did not find in these wild regions a single Thibetian
village.&nbsp; Every evening we lay in the Chinese guard-houses,
around which were grouped a few shepherds&rsquo; huts, made with
the bark of trees.&nbsp; During these four days, however, we
changed the oulah three several times without experiencing the
least delay.&nbsp; The orders had been so well given beforehand,
that on our arrival at each stage, we found everything ready
arranged for our departure on the morrow.</p>
<p>If we had not known that in these countries, desert in
appearance, there were shepherds living in the gorges of the
mountains, it would have been impossible for us to understand
this prompt organization of the oulah.&nbsp; Generally speaking,
it was only in large towns that the service of the caravan
experienced delays and difficulties.</p>
<p>On the fourth day of our departure from Ghiamda, after having
crossed a great lake on the ice, we stopped at the station Atdza,
a small village, the inhabitants of which cultivate a few acres
of land, in a little valley encircled by mountains, the tops of
which are covered with hollies and pines.&nbsp; The Chinese
Itinerary says, on the <!-- page 245--><a
name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 245</span>subject of
the lake you see before your arrival at Atdza, &ldquo;The
unicorn, a very curious animal, is found in the vicinity of this
lake, which is 40 lis long.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>The unicorn, which has long been regarded as a fabulous
creature, really exists in Thibet.&nbsp; You find it frequently
represented in the sculptures and paintings of the Buddhic
temples.&nbsp; Even in China, you often see it in the landscapes
that ornament the inns of the northern provinces. <a
name="citation245"></a><a href="#footnote245"
class="citation">[245]</a>&nbsp; The inhabitants of Atdza spoke
of it, without attaching to it any greater importance than to the
other species of antelopes which abound in their mountains.&nbsp;
We have not been fortunate enough to see the unicorn during our
travels in Upper Asia.&nbsp; But all we were there told about it
serves to confirm the curious details which Klaproth has
published on this subject in the new <i>Journal
Asiatique</i>.&nbsp; We think it not irrelevant <!-- page
246--><a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>to
give here an interesting note which that learned orientalist has
added to his translation of the &ldquo;Itinerary of
Lou-Hoa-Tchou.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The unicorn of Thibet is called, in the language of
this country, serou; in Mongol, kere; and in Chinese,
tou-kio-cheou: which means the one-horned animal, or kio-touan,
the straight horn.&nbsp; The Mongols sometimes confound the
unicorn with the rhinoceros, called in Mantchou, bodi-gourgou;
and in Sanscrit, khadga; calling the latter also,
kere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The unicorn is mentioned, for the first time, by the Chinese,
in one of their works, which treats of the history of the first
two ages of our era.&nbsp; It is there said that the wild horse,
the argali, and the kio-touan, are animals foreign to China; that
they belong to Tartary, and that they use the horns of the latter
to make the bows called unicorn bows.</p>
<p>The Chinese, Mahometans, and Mongol historians agree in the
following tradition, relative to a fact which took place in 1224,
when Tchinggiskhan was preparing to attack Hindostan.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This conqueror having subdued Thibet,&rdquo; says the
Mongol history, &ldquo;set out to penetrate into Enedkek
(India.)&nbsp; As he was ascending Mount Djadanaring, he
perceived a wild beast approaching him, of the species called
serou, which has but one horn on the top of the head.&nbsp; This
beast knelt thrice before the monarch, as if to show him
respect.&nbsp; Every one being astonished at this event, the
monarch exclaimed: &lsquo;The Empire of Hindostan is, they say,
the birth-place of the majestic Buddhas and the Buddhistavas, and
also of the powerful Bogdas or princes of antiquity.&nbsp; What
then can be the meaning of this dumb animal saluting me like a
human being?&rsquo;&nbsp; Having thus spoke, he returned to his
country.&rdquo;&nbsp; Although this circumstance is fabulous, it
demonstrates, nevertheless, the existence of a one-horned animal
on the upper mountains of Thibet.&nbsp; There are further, in
this country, places deriving their name from the great number of
these animals, which, in fact, live there in herds; for example,
the district of Serou-Dziong, which means, the village of the
land of unicorns, and which is situate in the eastern part of the
province of Kham, towards the frontier of China.</p>
<p>A Thibetian manuscript, which the late Major Lattre had an
opportunity of examining, calls the unicorn the one-horned
tsopo.&nbsp; A horn of this animal was sent to Calcutta: it was
fifty centimetres <a name="citation246"></a><a
href="#footnote246" class="citation">[246]</a> in length, and
twelve centimetres in circumference from the root; it grew
smaller and smaller, and terminated in a point.&nbsp; It <!--
page 247--><a name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
247</span>was almost straight, black, and somewhat flat at the
sides.&nbsp; It had fifteen rings, but they were only prominent
on one side.</p>
<p>Mr. Hodgson, an English resident in Nepaul, has at length
achieved the possession of a unicorn, and has put beyond doubt
the question relative to the existence of this species of
antelope, called tchirou, in Southern Thibet, which borders on
Nepaul.&nbsp; It is the same word with serou, only pronounced
differently, according to the varying dialects of the north and
of the south.</p>
<p>The skin and the horn, sent to Calcutta by Mr. Hodgson,
belonged to a unicorn that died in a menagerie of the Rajah of
Nepaul.&nbsp; It had been presented to this prince by the Lama of
Digourtchi (Jikazze), who was very fond of it.</p>
<p>The persons who brought the animal to Nepaul informed Mr.
Hodgson that the tchirou mostly frequented the beautiful valley
or plain of Tingri, situated in the southern part of the
Thibetian province of Tsang, and watered by the Arroun.&nbsp; To
go from Nepaul to this valley, you pass the defile of Kouti or
Nialam.&nbsp; The Nepaulese call the valley of Arroun
Tingri-Meidam, from the town of Tingri, which stands there on the
left bank of the river; it is full of salt-beds, round which the
tchirous assemble in herds.&nbsp; They describe these animals as
extremely fierce, when they are in their wild state; they do not
let any one approach them, and flee at the least noise.&nbsp; If
you attack them, they resist courageously.&nbsp; The male and the
female have generally the same aspect.</p>
<p>The form of the tchirou is graceful, like that of all the
other animals of the antelope tribe, and it has likewise the
incomparable eyes of the animals of that species; its colour is
reddish, like that of the fawn in the upper parts of the body,
and white below.&nbsp; Its distinctive features are, first a
black horn, long and pointed, with three slight curvatures, and
circular annulations towards the base; these annulations are more
prominent in front than behind; there are two tufts of hair which
project from the exterior of each nostril, and much down round
the nose and mouth, which gives the animal&rsquo;s head a heavy
appearance.&nbsp; The hair of the tchirou is rough, and seems
hollow, like that of all the animals north of the Himalaya that
Mr. Hodgson had the opportunity of examining.&nbsp; The hair is
about five centimetres long, and so thick that it seems to the
touch a solid mass.</p>
<p>Beneath the hair, the body of the tchirou is covered with a
very fine and delicate down, as are almost all the quadrupeds
that inhabit the lofty regions of the Himalaya mountain,
particularly the famous Cashmere goats.</p>
<p>Doctor Abel has proposed to give to the tchirou the systematic
<!-- page 248--><a name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
248</span>name of <i>Antelope Hodgsonii</i> after the name of the
learned person who has placed its existence beyond a doubt. <a
name="citation248"></a><a href="#footnote248"
class="citation">[248]</a></p>
<p>At Atdza we changed our oulah, although we had only fifty lis
to go before we reached the residence of Lha-Ri.&nbsp; We
required fresh animals accustomed to the dreadful road we had
below us.&nbsp; One single mountain separated us from Lha-Ri, and
to cross it it was, we were told, necessary to set out early in
the morning, if we wished to arrive before night.&nbsp; We
consulted the Itinerary, and we found there the following
agreeable account of the place: &ldquo;A little further on you
pass a lofty mountain, the summits of which rise in peaks.&nbsp;
The ice and snow never melt here throughout the year.&nbsp; Its
chasms resemble the declivitous shores of the sea; the wind often
fills them with snow; the paths are almost impracticable, the
descent is so rapid and slippery.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is obvious that
this brief but emphatic sketch did not hold out to us any very
agreeable pleasure trip for the morrow.&nbsp; Oh, how readily we
would have given up our places to some of those intrepid
tourists, whom the love of ice and snow, of rocks and precipices,
leads every year amidst the Alps, those mountains of Thibet in
miniature.</p>
<p>Another thing, very little calculated to encourage us, was,
that the people of the caravan, the villagers, everybody seemed
anxious and uneasy.&nbsp; They asked one another whether the
snow, which had fallen in abundance for five days, and had not
had time to settle, would not render the mountains impassable;
whether there was not a danger of being buried in the chasms, or
of being overwhelmed by the avalanches; whether, in a word, it
would not be prudent to wait a few days, in the hope that the
snow would be dispersed by the wind, or partly melted by the sun,
or consolidated by the cold.&nbsp; To all these questions, the
answers were anything but encouraging.&nbsp; In order to guard
against the effects of mere pusillanimity of presumption, we
held, before going to bed, a council, to which we summoned the
old mountaineers of the country.&nbsp; After long deliberation,
it was decided first, that if, on the morrow, the weather was
calm and serene, we might set out without temerity; secondly,
that in the supposition of departure, the long-haired oxen laden
with the baggage, and conducted by some people of the district,
should precede the horsemen, in order to trace out for them, <!--
page 249--><a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
249</span>in the snow, a more easy path.&nbsp; The matter being
thus determined, we tried to take a little rest, relying little
on the advantages of this plan, and much on the Divine
protection.</p>
<p>When we rose, a few stars were still shining in the heaven,
contending with the first rays of light; the weather was
wonderfully beautiful.&nbsp; We quickly made our preparations for
departure, and as soon as the last shades of night were
dissipated, we began to ascend the formidable Mountain of Spirits
(<i>Lha-Ri</i>).&nbsp; It rose before us like a huge block of
snow, whereon we perceived not a single tree, not a blade of
grass, not a dark spot to interrupt the uniformity of the
dazzling whiteness.&nbsp; As had been arranged, the long-haired
oxen, followed by their drivers, went first, advancing one after
the other; next came the horsemen, in single file, in their
steps, and the long caravan, like a gigantic serpent, slowly
developed its sinuosities on the mountain side.&nbsp; At first
the descent was by no means rapid, for we encountered frightful
quantities of snow, that threatened every instant to bury
us.&nbsp; We saw the oxen at the head of the column, advancing by
leaps, anxiously seeking the least perilous places, now to the
right, now to the left, sometimes disappearing all at once in
some deep rut, and struggling amidst those masses of moving snow,
like porpoises amid the billows of the ocean.&nbsp; The horsemen
who closed the cavalcade found a more solid footing.&nbsp; We
advanced slowly along the steep and narrow furrows traced out for
us between the walls of snow, that rose to the height of our
breasts.&nbsp; The air resounded with the bellowing of the oxen;
the horses panted loudly, and the men, to keep up the courage of
the caravan, raised, every now and then, a simultaneous shout
like that of mariners at the capstan.&nbsp; Gradually the route
became so steep, so precipitous, that the caravan seemed
suspended from the mountain&rsquo;s side.&nbsp; It was impossible
to remain on horseback; every one dismounted, and each clinging
to his horse&rsquo;s tail, resumed his march with renewed
ardour.&nbsp; The sun, shining in all its splendour, darted its
rays on these vast piles of snow, and caused them to emit
innumerable sparks, the flashing of which dazzled the eyes.&nbsp;
Fortunately, our visuals were sheltered by the inestimable
glasses that the Dheba of Ghiamda had given us.</p>
<p>After long and indescribable labour, we arrived, or rather,
were hauled up to the summit of the mountain.&nbsp; The sun was
already on the decline.&nbsp; We stopped for an instant, both to
re-adjust the saddles and fasten the baggage, and to remove from
the soles of our boots the masses of snow that had accumulated
upon them, and become consolidated into the form of cones
reversed.&nbsp; Every one was transported with joy.&nbsp; We felt
a sort of pride in being mounted so high, and in finding
ourselves standing on this gigantic <!-- page 250--><a
name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
250</span>pedestal.&nbsp; We took a pleasure in following with
our eyes the deep and tortuous path that had been hollowed out in
the snow, and the reddish tint of which was markedly outlined in
the otherwise spotless white of the mountain.</p>
<p>The descent was more precipitous than the ascent, but it was
much shorter, and did not require the exertion we had been
obliged to make on the other side of the mountain.&nbsp; The
extreme steepness of the way assisted us, on the contrary, in the
descent, for we had merely to let ourselves go; the only danger
was that of rolling down too fast, or of stepping out of the
beaten path, and being thus for ever buried in the bottom of some
abyss.&nbsp; In a country such as this, accidents of this
description are by no means chimerical.&nbsp; We descended easily
then, now standing, now seated, and without any other mischance
than a few falls and some protracted slides, more calculated to
excite the merriment than the fear of travellers.</p>
<p>Shortly before arriving at the base of the mountain, the whole
caravan halted on a level spot, where stood an Obo, or Buddhic
monument, consisting of piled up stones, surmounted by flags and
bones covered with Thibetian sentences.&nbsp; Some enormous and
majestic firs encircling the Obo, sheltered it with a magnificent
dome of verdure.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here we are, at the glacier of the
Mountain of Spirits,&rdquo; said Ly-Kouo-Ngan.&nbsp; &ldquo;We
shall have a bit of a laugh now.&rdquo;&nbsp; We regarded with
amazement the Pacificator of Kingdoms.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, here is
the glacier; look here.&rdquo;&nbsp; We proceeded to the spot he
indicated, bent over the edge of the plateau, and saw beneath us
an immense glacier jutting out very much, and bordered with
frightful precipices.&nbsp; We could distinguish, under the light
coating of snow, the greenish hue of the ice.&nbsp; We took a
stone from the Buddhic monument, and threw it down the
glacier.&nbsp; A loud noise was heard, and the stone gliding down
rapidly, left after it a broad green line.&nbsp; The place was
clearly a glacier, and we now comprehended partly
Ly-Kouo-Ngan&rsquo;s remark, but we saw nothing at all laughable
in being obliged to travel over such a road.&nbsp; Ly-Kouo-Ngan,
however, was right in every point, as we now found by
experience.</p>
<p>They made the animals go first, the oxen, and then the
horses.&nbsp; A magnificent long-haired ox opened the march; he
advanced gravely to the edge of the plateau; then, after
stretching out his neck, smelling for a moment at the ice, and
blowing through his large nostrils some thick clouds of vapour,
he manfully put his two front feet on the glacier, and whizzed
off as if he had been discharged from a cannon.&nbsp; He went
down the glacier with his legs extended, but as stiff and
motionless as if they had been made of marble.&nbsp; Arrived at
the bottom, he turned over, and then ran on, <!-- page 251--><a
name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 251</span>bounding
and bellowing over the snow.&nbsp; All the animals, in turn,
afforded us the same spectacle, which was really full of
interest.&nbsp; The horses, for the most part, exhibited, before
they started off, somewhat more hesitation than the oxen; but it
was easy to see that all of them had been long accustomed to this
kind of exercise.</p>
<p>The men, in their turn, embarked with no less intrepidity and
success than the animals, although in an altogether different
manner.&nbsp; We seated ourselves carefully on the edge of the
glacier, we stuck our heels close together on the ice, as firmly
as possible, then using the handles of our whips by way of helm,
we sailed over these frozen waters with the velocity of a
locomotive.&nbsp; A sailor would have pronounced us to be going
at least twelve knots an hour.&nbsp; In our many travels, we had
never before experienced a mode of conveyance at once so
commodious, so expeditious, and, above all, so refreshing.</p>
<p>At the foot of the glacier, each caught his horse as soon as
he could, and we continued our journey in the ordinary
style.&nbsp; After a somewhat rapid descent, we left behind us
the Mountain of Spirits, and entered a valley, sprinkled here and
there with patches of snow, that had withstood the rays of the
sun.&nbsp; We rode for a few minutes along the frozen banks of a
small river, and reached at length the station of Lha-Ri.&nbsp;
We had, at the gate of this town, as at Ghiamda, a military
reception.&nbsp; The Dheba of the place came to offer us his
services, and we proceeded to occupy the lodging that had been
prepared for us, in a Chinese pagoda, called Kouang-Ti-Miao, <a
name="citation251"></a><a href="#footnote251"
class="citation">[251]</a> which means the temple of the god of
war.&nbsp; From Lha-Ssa to Lha-Ri, they reckon 1,010 lis (101
leagues); we had been fifteen days travelling the distance.</p>
<p>As soon as we were installed in our residence, it was agreed
unanimously, among Ly-Kouo-Ngan, the Lama Dsiamdchang, and
ourselves, that we should stop one day at Lha-Ri.&nbsp; Although
the oulah was all ready, we considered it better to make a brief
halt, in order to reinstate, by a day&rsquo;s repose, the
strength we should require for climbing another formidable
mountain, that lay in our way.</p>
<p>The large village of Lha-Ri is built in a gorge, surrounded by
barren and desolate mountains; this district does not exhibit the
<!-- page 252--><a name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
252</span>least signs of cultivation, so that the people have to
get their flour from Tsing-Kou.&nbsp; The inhabitants are nearly
all shepherds; they breed sheep, oxen, and, especially, goats,
the fine silky hair of which is used in the fabric of poulou of
the first quality, and of those beautiful manufactures, so well
known by the name of Cashmere shawls.&nbsp; The Thibetians of
Lha-Ri are much less advanced in civilization than those of
Lha-Ssa; their physiognomy is hard and rugged; they are dirty in
their clothing; their houses are merely large, shapeless hovels,
made of rough stone, and rudely plastered with lime.&nbsp; You
remark, however, on the side of the mountain, a little above the
village, a vast Buddhic monastery, the temple of which is fine
enough.&nbsp; A Kampo is the superior of this Lamasery, and, at
the same time, temporal administrator of the district.&nbsp; The
numerous Lamas of Lha-Ri lead an idle, miserable life; we saw
them, at all hours of the day, squatting in the different
quarters of the town, trying to warm, in the rays of the sun,
their limbs, half covered with a few red and yellow
rags,&mdash;it was a disgusting sight.</p>
<p>At Lha-Ri, the Chinese government maintains a magazine of
provisions, under the management of a learned Mandarin, bearing
the title of Leang-Tai (purveyor), and decorated with the button
of white crystal.&nbsp; The Leang-Tai has to pay the various
garrisons quartered on his line of road.&nbsp; There are, between
Lha-Ssa and the frontiers of China, six of these provision
magazines.&nbsp; The first and most important, is at Lha-Ssa; the
Leang-Tai of which town superintends the five others, and
receives an annual salary of seventy ounces of silver, whereas
his colleagues have only sixty.&nbsp; The maintenance of the
provisional magazine at Lha-Ssa costs the Chinese government
40,000 ounces of silver per annum; while that at Lha-Ri costs
only 8,000 ounces.&nbsp; The garrison of the latter town consists
of 130 soldiers, having at their head a Tsien-Tsoung, a
Pa-Tsoung, and a Wei-Wei.</p>
<p>The day after our arrival at Lha-Ri, the Leang-Tai, or
purveyor, instead of coming to pay an official visit to the staff
of the caravan, contented himself with sending us, by way of
card, a leaf of red paper on which were inscribed the letters of
his name; he added, by the mouth of his messenger, that a severe
illness confined him to his room.&nbsp; Ly-Kouo-Ngan said to us,
in a whisper, and with a sly laugh, &ldquo;The Leang-Tai will
recover as soon as we are gone.&rdquo;&nbsp; When we were left
alone, he said, &ldquo;Ah, I knew how it would be: every time a
caravan passes, Leang-Tai-Sue (the name of the Mandarin) is at
death&rsquo;s door; that is well understood by everybody.&nbsp;
According to the usages of hospitality, he should have prepared
for us to-day a feast of the first class, and it is to <!-- page
253--><a name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
253</span>avoid this, that he feigns illness.&nbsp; The
Leang-Tai-Sue is the most avaricious man imaginable; he never
dressed better than a palanquin bearer; he eats tsamba like a
barbarian of Thibet.&nbsp; He never smokes, he never plays, he
never drinks wine; in the evening his house is not lighted; he
gropes his way to bed in the dark, and rises very late in the
morning, for fear of being hungry too early.&nbsp; Oh, a creature
like that is not a man; &rsquo;tis a mere tortoise-egg!&nbsp; The
ambassador Ki-Chan is resolved to dismiss him, and he will do
well.&nbsp; Have you any Leang-Tais of this kind in your
country?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What a question!&nbsp; The
Leang-Tais of the kingdom of France never go to bed without a
candle, and when the oulah passes through their town, they never
fail to get ready a good dinner.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, that is
the thing! those are the rites of hospitality! but this
Sue-Mou-Tchou&mdash;&rdquo; at these words we burst into a hearty
fit of laughter.&nbsp; &ldquo;By-the-by,&rdquo; asked we,
&ldquo;do you know why the Leang-Tai-Sue is called Sue-Mou-Tchou;
the name seems to us somewhat ignoble?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ignoble, indeed; but it has reference to a very singular
anecdote.&nbsp; Leang-Tai-Sue, before he was sent to Lha-Ri,
exercised the functions of Mandarin in a small district of the
province of Kiang-Si.&nbsp; One day, two labourers presented
themselves at his tribunal, and besought him to give judgment in
the matter of a sow, which they both claimed.&nbsp; Judge Sue
pronounced thus his decision: &lsquo;Having separated truth from
fiction, I see clearly that this sow belongs neither to you, nor
to you; I declare, therefore, that it belongs to me: respect this
judgment.&rsquo;&nbsp; The officers of the court proceeded to
take possession of the sow, and the judge had it sold in the
market.&nbsp; Since that occurrence, Mandarin Sue has been always
called Sue-Mou-Tchou (Sue the sow).&rdquo;&nbsp; The recital of
this story made us deeply regret that we must depart without
seeing the physiognomy of this interesting individual.</p>
<p>We left the town of Lha-Ri in changeable weather; our first
day&rsquo;s march was only sixty lis, and offered nothing
remarkable, except a large lake which they say is eight lis in
breadth and ten in length: it was frozen, and we crossed it
easily, thanks to a slight coating of snow with which it was
covered.&nbsp; We lodged in a miserable hamlet, called
Tsa-Tchou-Ka, near which are hot springs.&nbsp; The Thibetians
bathe there, and do not fail to attribute to them marvellous
properties.</p>
<p>The next day was a day of great fatigue and tribulation; we
crossed the mountain Chor-Kou-La, which, for its height and
ruggedness, may well rival that of Lha-Ri.&nbsp; We began its
ascent, our hearts full of anxiety, for the clouded and lowering
sky that hung over us, seemed to presage wind or snow; the mercy
of God preserved us from both the one and the other.&nbsp;
Towards mid-day, <!-- page 254--><a name="page254"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 254</span>there rose a light north wind, the
cutting cold of which soon chapped our faces; but it was not
strong enough to raise the thick coat of snow which covered the
mountain.</p>
<p>As soon as we had reached the summit, we rested for a moment
under the shade of a large stone obo, and dined on a pipe of
tobacco.&nbsp; During this frugal repast, the Mandarin
Ly-Kouo-Ngan told us, that in the time of the wars of Kien-Long
against Thibet, the Chinese troops, exasperated by the fatigues
and privations of a long journey, mutinied as they were passing
Chor-Kou-La.&nbsp; &ldquo;On this plateau,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;the soldiers arrested their officers, and after having
bound them, threatened to precipitate them into this gulf, unless
they promised them increased pay.&nbsp; The generals having
agreed to do right to the claims of the army, the sedition was
appeased, the Mandarins were set at liberty, and they quietly
continued their march to Lha-Ri.&nbsp; As soon as they arrived in
this town, the generals made good their promise, and increased
the pay; but, at the same time, these insubordinate soldiers were
mercilessly decimated.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And what did the
soldiers say?&rdquo; inquired we of Ly-Kouo-Ngan.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Those upon whom the lot did not fall, laughed heartily,
and declared that their officers had shown great
ability.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On quitting the summit of Chor-Kou-La, you follow a somewhat
inclined path, and continue for several days on an extensive,
high ground, the numerous ramifications of which stretch afar
their pointed tops and the sharp needles of their peaks.&nbsp;
From Lha-Ssa to the province of Sse-Tchouen, through all this
long route, nothing is to be seen but immense chains of
mountains, intersected with cataracts, deep gulfs, and narrow
defiles.&nbsp; These mountains are now all heaped up together,
presenting to the view the most varied and fantastic outlines;
now they are ranged symmetrically, one against the other, like
the teeth of a huge saw.&nbsp; These regions change their aspect
every instant, and offer to the contemplation of travellers
landscapes of infinite variety; yet, amidst this inexhaustible
diversity, the continuous sight of mountains diffuses over the
route a certain uniformity which after awhile becomes
tiresome.&nbsp; A detailed account of a journey in Thibet being
extremely susceptible of monotony, we abstain, that we may not
fall into unnecessary repetitions from describing the ordinary
mountains.&nbsp; We shall content ourselves with mentioning the
most celebrated&mdash;those which, in the Chinese phrase,
&ldquo;claim the life of travellers.&rdquo;&nbsp; This method,
besides, will be conformable with the style of the inhabitants of
these mountainous countries, who call whatever is not lost in the
clouds, <i>plain</i>; whatever is not precipice and labyrinth,
<i>level road</i>.</p>
<p>The high grounds we traversed, after surmounting the
Chor-Kou-La, <!-- page 255--><a name="page255"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 255</span>
<a href="images/p255.jpg">

</a> are considered by the natives level ground.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Thence to Alan-To,&rdquo; said the Thibetian escort to us,
&ldquo;there is no mountain; the path is all like that,&rdquo;
showing us the palm of their hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yet,&rdquo; said
they, &ldquo;it is necessary to use a good deal of precaution,
for the paths are sometimes very narrow and
slippery.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now hear what, in reality, was this same
road, &ldquo;as flat as the palm of your hand.&rdquo;&nbsp; As
soon as you have quitted the summits of Chor-Kou-La, you
encounter a long series of frightful chasms, bordered on each
side by mountains cut perpendicularly, and rising up like <!--
page 256--><a name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
256</span>two vast walls of living rock.&nbsp; Travellers are
obliged to pass these deep abysses by following, at a great
height, so narrow a ledge, that the horses frequently find only
just enough room to plant their feet.&nbsp; As soon as we saw the
oxen of the caravan making their way along this horrible path,
and heard the low roar of the waters rising from the depths of
those gulfs, we were seized with fear, and dismounted, but every
one at once told us immediately to remount, saying that the
horses, accustomed to the journey, had surer feet than we; that
we must let them go their own way, contenting ourselves with
keeping firmly in our stirrups, and not looking about us.&nbsp;
We recommended our souls to God, and followed in the wake of the
column.&nbsp; We were soon convinced that, in point of fact, it
would have been impossible for us to keep our equilibrium on this
slippery and rugged surface; it seemed as though, at every
moment, an invisible force was drawing us towards those
fathomless gulfs.&nbsp; Lest we should get giddy, we kept our
heads turned towards the mountain, the declivity of which was
sometimes so perpendicular, that it did not even offer a ledge
for the horses to plant their feet on.&nbsp; In such places we
passed over large trunks of trees, supported by piles fixed
horizontally in the mountain side.&nbsp; At the very sight of
these frightful bridges we felt a cold perspiration running from
all our limbs.&nbsp; It was essential, however, to advance, for
to return or to dismount were two things beyond possibility.</p>
<p>After having been for two days constantly suspended between
life and death, we at length got clear of this route, the most
dreadful and most dangerous imaginable, and arrived at
Alan-To.&nbsp; Every one was rejoiced, and we congratulated each
other on not having fallen into the abyss.&nbsp; Each recounted,
with a sort of feverish excitement, the terrors he had
experienced in the most difficult parts of the passage.&nbsp; The
Dheba of Alan-To, on hearing that no one had perished, expressed
his opinion that the caravan had been unprecedentedly
fortunate.&nbsp; Three oxen laden with baggage had indeed been
swallowed up, but these mischances were not worth talking
about.&nbsp; Ly-Kouo-Ngan told us that he had never passed the
defile of Alan-To without witnessing frightful accidents.&nbsp;
In his previous journey, four soldiers had been precipitated from
the top of the mountain with the horses they rode.&nbsp; Every
one was able to recount catastrophes, the mere recital of which
made our hair stand on end.&nbsp; They had forborne to mention
them before, for fear of our refusing to continue the
journey.&nbsp; In fact, if we could have seen at Lha-Ssa, the
frightful abysses of Alan-To, it is probable that the ambassador
Ki-Chan would scarcely have succeeded in inducing us to attempt
this journey.</p>
<p>From Alan-To, where we changed oulah, we descended through
<!-- page 257--><a name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
257</span>a thick forest of firs, into a valley where we stopped,
after eighty lis march, at a village called Lang-Ki-Tsoung.&nbsp;
This post is one of the most picturesque and most agreeable we
had met throughout our journey.&nbsp; It is situate amidst the
centre of a plain, bounded on all sides by low mountains, the
sides of which are covered with trees of fine growth.&nbsp; The
country is fertile, and the Thibetians of the district seem to
cultivate it with much care.&nbsp; The fields are watered by an
abundant stream, the waters of which drift down a large quantity
of gold sand, for which reason, the Chinese give this valley the
name of Kin-Keou (gold.)</p>
<p>The houses of Lang-Ki-Tsoung are very singularly constructed;
they are absolutely nothing more than trunks of trees, stripped
of their bark, and with the two extremities cut off; so that they
may be nearly of the same size throughout.&nbsp; Enormous piles
are first driven into the earth to a great depth; the part
remaining above ground being at most two feet in height.&nbsp;
Upon these piles they arrange horizontally, one beside the other,
the trunks of fir which they have prepared; these form the
foundation and the floor of the house.&nbsp; Other fir trees
similarly prepared, and laid one upon the other, serve to form
walls remarkable for their thickness and solidity.&nbsp; The roof
is likewise formed of trunks, covered with large pieces of bark,
arranged like slates.&nbsp; These houses exactly resemble
enormous cages, the bars of which are closely fixed against each
other.&nbsp; If between the joints they discover any cracks they
stop these up with argols.&nbsp; They sometimes build in this
fashion very large houses, of several stories high, very warm,
and always free from damp.&nbsp; Their only inconvenience is
their having very uneven and disagreeable floors.&nbsp; If the
inhabitants of Lang-Ki-Tsoung ever take it into their heads to
give balls, they will, it is most likely, be obliged to modify
their plan of house construction.&nbsp; Whilst we were waiting
patiently and in silence in our big cage until they should please
to serve up supper, the Dheba of Lang-Ki-Tsoung, and the corporal
of the Chinese guard, came to tell us that they had a little
point to settle with us.&nbsp; &ldquo;What point?&rdquo; cried
Ly-Kouo-Ngan, with an important air, &ldquo;what point?&nbsp; Oh,
I see, the oulah is not ready.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is not
that,&rdquo; answered the Dheba.&nbsp; &ldquo;Never at
Lang-Ki-Tsoung has any one to wait for his oulah; you shall have
it this evening, if you like, but I must warn you that the
mountain of Tanda is impassable; for eight consecutive days, the
snow has fallen in such abundance that the roads are not yet
open.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We have passed the Chor-Kou-La, why
should we not with equal success pass the Tanda?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;What is the Chor-Kou-La to the Tanda? these mountains are
not to be compared with each other.&nbsp; Yesterday, three men,
of the district of Tanda, chose to <!-- page 258--><a
name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 258</span>venture
upon the mountain, two of them have disappeared in the snow, the
third arrived here this morning alone and on foot, for his horse
was also swallowed up.&nbsp; However,&rdquo; said the Dheba,
&ldquo;you can go when you like; the oulah is at your service,
but you will have to pay for the oxen and horses that will die on
the way.&rdquo;&nbsp; Having thus stated his ultimatum, the
Thibetian diplomatist put out his tongue at us, scratched his
ear, and withdrew.&nbsp; Whilst the Pacificator of Kingdoms, the
Lama Dsiamdchang, and a few other experienced persons belonging
to the caravan, were discussing earnestly the question of
departure, we took up the Chinese Itinerary, and read there the
following passage: &ldquo;The mountain of Tanda is extremely
precipitous and difficult of ascent; a stream meanders through a
narrow ravine: during the summer it is miry and slippery, and
during the winter it is covered with ice and snow.&nbsp;
Travellers, provided with sticks, pass it, one after the other,
like a file of fish.&nbsp; It is the most difficult passage on
the whole way to Lha-Ssa.&rdquo;&nbsp; On reading this last
sentence, the book fell from our hands.&nbsp; After a
moment&rsquo;s stupor, we resumed the book, in order to assure
our selves that we had read correctly.&nbsp; We were right; there
it was written: &ldquo;It is the most difficult passage on all
the way to Lha-Ssa.&rdquo;&nbsp; The prospect of having to pursue
a still more arduous route than that of Alan-To was enough to
stagnate the blood in our veins.&nbsp; &ldquo;The ambassador
Ki-Chan,&rdquo; said we to ourselves, &ldquo;is evidently a
cowardly assassin.&nbsp; Not having dared to kill us at Lha-Ssa,
he has sent us to die in the midst of the snow.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
fit of depression lasted but for an instant; God, in his
goodness, gradually restored to us all our energies, and we rose
to take part in the discussion which was proceeding around us,
and the result of which was that, on the morrow, a few men of the
caravan should set out before daybreak to sound the depth of the
snow, and to assure themselves of the real state of the
case.&nbsp; Towards midday the scouts returned, and announced
that Mount Tanda was impassable.&nbsp; These tidings distressed
all of us.&nbsp; We ourselves, although in no great hurry, were
annoyed.&nbsp; The weather was beautiful, and we apprehended that
if we did not profit by it, we should soon have fresh snow, and
thus see our departure indefinitely adjourned.&nbsp; Whilst we
were anxiously deliberating what we should do, the Dheba of the
place came to relieve us from our embarrassment.&nbsp; He
proposed to send a herd of oxen to trample down, for two days,
the snow that encumbered the path up the mountain.&nbsp;
&ldquo;With this precaution,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if the
weather continues fine, you may, without fear, depart on your
journey.&rdquo;&nbsp; The proposition of the Dheba was eagerly
and gratefully adopted.</p>
<p>Whilst we waited until the long-haired oxen had made us a
path, <!-- page 259--><a name="page259"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 259</span>we enjoyed at Lang-Ki-Tsoung, a few
days of salutary and agreeable repose.&nbsp; The Thibetians of
this valley were more kindly and civilized than those we had
encountered since our departure from Lha-Ri.&nbsp; Every evening
and morning they furnished us abundantly with the appliances of
cookery; they brought us pheasants, venison, fresh butter, and a
sort of small sweet tubercle which they gather on the
mountains.&nbsp; Prayer, walks, and some games of chess,
contributed to the delights of these days of leisure.&nbsp; The
chessmen which we used had been given to us by the Regent of
Lha-Ssa; the pieces were made of ivory, and represented various
animals sculptured with some delicacy.&nbsp; The Chinese, as is
known, are passionately fond of chess, but their game is very
different from ours.&nbsp; The Tartars and the Thibetians are
likewise acquainted with chess; and singularly enough, their
chessboard is absolutely the same as our own; their pieces,
although differently formed, represent the same value as ours and
follow the same moves, and the rules of the game are precisely
the same in every respect.&nbsp; What is still more surprising,
these people cry <i>chik</i> when they check a piece, and
<i>mate</i> when the game is at an end.&nbsp; These expressions,
which are neither Thibetian nor Mongol, are nevertheless used by
every one, yet no one can explain their origin and true
signification.&nbsp; The Thibetians and the Tartars were not a
little surprised, when we told them that, in our country, we said
in the same way, <i>check</i> and <i>mate</i>.</p>
<p>It would be curious to unravel the arch&aelig;ology of the
game of chess, to seek its origin and its progress amongst
various nations, its introduction into Upper Asia, with the same
rules and the same technical phrases that we have in
Europe.&nbsp; This labour appertains, of right, to the
<i>Palamede, Revue francaise des &eacute;checs</i>.&nbsp; We have
seen among the Tartars first-rate players of chess; they play
quickly, and with less study, it seemed to us, than the Europeans
apply, but their moves are not the less correct.</p>
<p>After three days&rsquo; rest, the Dheba of Lang-Ki-Tsoung
having announced to us that the long-haired oxen had sufficiently
trampled down the mountain paths, we departed; the sky was
clouded, and the wind blew briskly.&nbsp; When we reached the
foot of Tanda, we perceived a long dark line moving, like a huge
caterpillar, slowly along the precipitous sides of the
mountain.&nbsp; The guides of Lang-Ki-Tsoung told us that it was
a troop of Lamas returning from a pilgrimage to Lha-Ssa-Morou,
and who had encamped for the night at the other end of the
valley.&nbsp; The sight of these numerous travellers restored our
courage, and we resolutely undertook the ascent of the
mountain.&nbsp; Before we reached the top, the wind began to blow
violently, and drove about the snow in every direction.&nbsp; It
seemed as though the whole mountain was falling to pieces; the
<!-- page 260--><a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
260</span>ascent became so steep, that neither men nor animals
had strength enough to climb up.&nbsp; The horses stumbled at
almost every step, and if they had not been kept up by the large
masses of snow, on more than one occasion they would have been
precipitated into the valley of Lang-Ki-Tsoung.&nbsp; M. Gabet,
who had not yet recovered from the illness which our first
journey had occasioned him, could scarcely reach the top of
Tanda; not having sufficient strength to grasp the tail of his
horse, he fell from exhaustion, and became almost buried in the
snow.&nbsp; The Thibetian escort went to his assistance, and
succeeded, after long and painful exertions, in getting him to
the top, where he arrived more dead than alive; his face was of a
livid paleness, and his heaving breast sent forth a sound like
the death-rattle.</p>
<p>We met on the top of the mountain the Lama pilgrims, who had
preceded us; they were all lying in the snow, having beside them
their long iron-ferruled sticks.&nbsp; Some asses, laden with
baggage, were packed one against the other, shivering in the cold
wind, and hanging down their long ears.&nbsp; When all had
sufficiently recovered breath, we resumed our march.&nbsp; The
descent being almost perpendicular, we had only to sit down, and
leave it to our own weight to secure our making a rapid
journey.&nbsp; The snow, under these circumstances, was rather
favourable than otherwise; it formed on the asperities of the
ground a thick carpet which enabled us to slide down with
impunity.&nbsp; We had only to deplore the loss of an ass, which,
choosing to get out of the beaten path, was precipitated into an
abyss.</p>
<p>As soon as we reached Tanda, the Mandarin, Ly-Kouo-Ngan, shook
off the snow which covered his clothes, put on his hat of
ceremony, and proceeded, accompanied by all his soldiers, to a
small Chinese pagoda we had seen on our entrance into the
village.&nbsp; It is reported that at the time of the wars of
Kien-Long against the Thibetians, one of the Leang-Tai, charged
with victualling the Chinese army, crossed during the winter the
mountain of Tanda on his way to Lha-Ri.&nbsp; On passing the
brink of an abyss filled with snow, a long-haired ox let fall a
coffer of silver with which it was laden.&nbsp; On seeing this,
the Leang-Tai sprang from his horse, threw himself upon the
coffer, which he grasped in his arms, and rolled, without
relaxing his hold of the treasure, to the bottom of the
gulf.&nbsp; Tradition adds, that in the spring, the snow having
melted, they found the Leang-Tai standing on his coffer of
money.&nbsp; The Emperor Kien-Long, in honour of the devotion of
this faithful commissary, who had so faithfully abided by his
trust, named him the Spirit of the Mountain of Tanda, and raised
a pagoda to him in the village.&nbsp; The Mandarins who journey
to Lha-Ssa, never fail to <!-- page 261--><a
name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 261</span>visit this
temple, and to prostrate themselves thrice before the idol of the
Leang-Tai.&nbsp; The Chinese emperors are in the habit of
deifying in this manner civil or military officers whose life has
been signalized by some memorable act, and the worship rendered
to these constitutes the official religion of the Mandarins.</p>

</a></p>
<p>On leaving the village of Tanda, you travel for sixty lis on a
plain called Pian-Pa, which, according to the Chinese Itinerary,
is the most extensive in Thibet.&nbsp; If this statement be
correct, Thibet must be a very detestable country; for, in the
first place, this so-called plain, is constantly intercepted by
hills and ravines, and in the second place, it is so limited in
extent, that any one in the centre of it can easily distinguish a
man at the foot of the surrounding mountains.&nbsp; After passing
the plain of Pian-Pa, you follow, for fifty lis, the serpentine
course of a small mountain stream, and then reach Lha-Dze, where
you change the oulah.</p>
<p>From Lha-Dze to the stage of Barilang is 100 lis journey;
two-thirds of the way are occupied by the famous mountain of
Dchak-La, which is of the number of those that are reputed
murderous, <!-- page 262--><a name="page262"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 262</span>and which, for that reason, the
Chinese call Yao-Ming-Ti-Chan; that is to say, <i>Mountain that
claims life</i>.&nbsp; We effected its ascent and descent without
any accident.&nbsp; We did not even get tired, for we were
becoming used, by daily practice, to the hard employment of
scaling mountains.</p>
<p>From Barilang we pursued a tolerably easy route, whence we
observed, rising here and there, the smoke from a few poor
Thibetian dwellings, isolated in the gorges of the
mountains.&nbsp; We saw some black tents, and numerous herds of
long-haired oxen.&nbsp; After a journey of 100 lis we reached
Chobando.</p>
<p>Chobando is a small town, the houses and lamaseries of which,
painted with a solution of red ochre, present, in the distance, a
singular and not disagreeable appearance.&nbsp; The town is built
on the slope of a mountain, and is enclosed, in front, by a
narrow but deep river, which you cross on a wooden bridge, that
shakes and groans under the feet of travellers, and seems every
moment about to break down.&nbsp; Chobando is the most important
military station you find after quitting Lha-Ri; its garrison
consists of twenty-five soldiers and of an officer bearing the
title of Tsien-Tsoung.&nbsp; This military Mandarin vas an
intimate friend of Ly, the pacificator of kingdoms; they had
served together for several years on the frontiers of
Gorkha.&nbsp; We were invited to sup with the Tsien-Tsoung, who
managed to give us, amidst these wild and mountainous regions, a
splendid repast, where were displayed Chinese delicacies of every
description.&nbsp; During supper the two brothers-in-arms enjoyed
the satisfaction of recounting to each other their former
adventures.</p>
<p>Just as we were going to bed, two horsemen, having belts
adorned with bells, came into the courtyard of the inn; they
stopped for a few minutes, and then set off again at full
gallop.&nbsp; We were informed that it was the
courier-extraordinary, bearing dispatches from the ambassador
Ki-Chan to Peking.&nbsp; He had quitted Lha-Ssa only six days
before, so that he had already travelled more than 2,000 lis (200
leagues).&nbsp; Ordinarily, the dispatches only occupy thirty
days between Lha-Ssa and Peking.&nbsp; This speed will,
doubtless, seem in no way prodigious when compared with that of
the couriers of Europe; but, making allowance for the excessive
difficulties of the journey, it will perhaps be considered
surprising.&nbsp; The express couriers, who carry the mails in
Thibet, travel day and night; they always go in twos, a Chinese
soldier and a Thibetian guide.&nbsp; At about every hundred lis,
they find on the road a change of horses, but the men are not
relieved so often.&nbsp; These couriers travel fastened to their
saddles by straps; they are in the habit of observing a day of
rigorous fast before mounting their horses, and <!-- page
263--><a name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
263</span>all the time they are on duty, they content themselves
with swallowing two raw eggs at every stage.&nbsp; The men who
perform this arduous labour rarely attain an advanced age; many
of them fall into the abysses or remain buried in the snow.&nbsp;
Those who escape the perils of the road fall victims to the
diseases which they readily contract in these dreadful
regions.&nbsp; We have never been able to conceive how these
couriers travelled by night among these mountains of Thibet,
where almost at every step you find frightful precipices.</p>
<p>You see at Chobando two Buddhic monasteries, where numerous
Lamas reside, belonging to the sect of the Yellow Cap.&nbsp; In
one of these monasteries there is a great printing press, which
furnishes sacred books to the Lamaseries of the province of
Kham.</p>
<p>From Chobando, after two long and arduous days&rsquo; march,
in the turnings and windings of the mountains, and through
immense forests of pine and holly, you reach Kia-Yu-Kiao.&nbsp;
This village is built on the rugged banks of the river
Souk-Tchou, which flows between two mountains, and the waters of
which are wide, deep, and rapid.&nbsp; On our arrival we found
the inhabitants of Kia-Yu-Kiao in a state of profound
grief.&nbsp; Not long before, a large wooden bridge, thrown over
the river, had broken down, and two men and three oxen who were
upon it at the time perished in the waters.&nbsp; We could still
see the remains of this bridge, built of large trunks of trees;
the wood, completely rotten, showed that the bridge had fallen
from decay.&nbsp; At sight of these sad ruins, we thanked
Providence for having kept us three days on the other side of the
mountain of Tanda.&nbsp; If we had arrived at Kia-Yu-Kiao before
the fall of the bridge, it would probably have sunk under the
weight of the caravan.</p>
<p>Contrary to our expectation, this accident caused us no
delay.&nbsp; The Dheba of the place hastened to construct a raft;
and on the morrow we were able, at daybreak, to resume our
march.&nbsp; The men, baggage, and saddles crossed the river on
the raft, the animals swimming.</p>
<p>Thirty lis from Kia-Yu-Kiao, we came to a wooden bridge,
suspended over a frightful precipice.&nbsp; Having our
imaginations still full of the accident at Kia-Yu-Kiao, we felt,
at sight of this perilous pass, a cold shudder of terror pervade
all our limbs.&nbsp; As a matter of precaution, we made the
animals pass first, one after the other; the bridge trembled and
shook under them, but held firm; the men went next.&nbsp; They
advanced gently on their toes, making themselves as light as
possible.&nbsp; All passed safely, and the caravan proceeded
again in its usual order.&nbsp; After having surmounted a rocky
and precipitous hill, at the foot of which roared an impetuous
torrent, we stayed for the night at Wa-Ho-Tchai, a station
composed of a barracks, small Chinese temple, and three or four
Thibetian huts.</p>
<p><!-- page 264--><a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
264</span>Immediately after our arrival the snow began to fall in
great flakes.&nbsp; In any other place, such weather would have
been merely disagreeable; at Wa-Ho-Tchai, it was
calamitous.&nbsp; We had next day to travel a stage of 150 lis,
on a plateau famous throughout Thibet.&nbsp; The Itinerary gave
us the following details as to this route: &ldquo;On the mountain
Wa-Ho, there is a lake.&nbsp; That people may not lose themselves
in the thick fogs which prevail here, there have been fixed on
the heights wooden signals.&nbsp; When the mountain is covered
with deep snow you are guided by these signals; but you must take
care not to make a noise; you must abstain from even uttering a
word, otherwise the ice and snow will fall upon you in abundance,
and with astonishing rapidity.&nbsp; Throughout the mountain you
find neither beast nor bird, for it is frozen during the four
seasons of the year.&nbsp; On its sides, and within 100 lis
distance there is no dwelling.&nbsp; Many Chinese soldiers and
Thibetians die there of cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The soldiers of the garrison of Wa-Ho-Tchai, finding that the
weather seemed really made up for snow, opened the gates of the
little pagoda, and lighted a number of small red candles in front
of a formidable-looking idol, brandishing a sword in its right
hand, and holding in the other a bow and a bundle of
arrows.&nbsp; They then struck, with repeated blows, on a small
tam-tam, and executed a flourish on a tambourine.&nbsp;
Ly-Kouo-Ngan assumed his official costume, and went to prostrate
himself before the idol.&nbsp; On his return we asked in whose
honour this pagoda had been raised.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is the pagoda
of Kiang-Kian <a name="citation264"></a><a href="#footnote264"
class="citation">[264]</a> Mao-Ling.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And what
did Kiang-Kian do, that he is thus honoured?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, I see that you are ignorant of these events of times
gone by.&nbsp; I will tell you about him.&nbsp; In the reign of
Khang-Hi the empire was at war with Thibet.&nbsp; Mao-Ling was
sent against the rebels in the rank of generalissimo.&nbsp; Just
as he was going to pass the mountain Wa-Ho, with a body of 4,000
men, some of the people of the locality who acted as guides,
warned him that every one, in crossing the mountain, must observe
silence, under penalty of being buried beneath the snow.&nbsp;
Kiang-Kian issued forthwith an edict to his soldiers, and the
army proceeded in the most profound silence.&nbsp; As the
mountain was too long for the soldiers, laden with baggage, to
cross it in a single day, they encamped on the plateau.&nbsp;
Conformably with the established rule in large towns of the
empire, and of camps in time of war, as soon as it was night they
fired off a cannon, Mao-Ling <!-- page 265--><a
name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>not daring
to infringe this rule of military discipline.&nbsp; The report of
the cannon had scarcely subsided, when enormous blocks of snow
came pouring down from the sky upon the mountain.&nbsp;
Kiang-Kian and all his men were buried beneath the fall, and no
one has ever since discovered their bodies.&nbsp; The only
persons saved were the cook and three servants of Kiang-Kian, who
had gone on before, and arrived that same day in the village
where we are.&nbsp; The Emperor Khang-Hi created Kiang-Kian
Mao-Ling tutelary genius of the mountain Wa-Ho, and had this
pagoda erected to him, on the condition of protecting travellers
from the snow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ly-Kouo-Ngan, having finished his story, we asked him who was
the potent being that sent down these terrible masses of snow,
ice, and hail, when any one presumed to make a noise in crossing
the mountain Wa-Ho?&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, that is perfectly
clear,&rdquo; answered he; &ldquo;it is the Spirit of the
Mountain, the Hia-Ma-Tching-Chin&rdquo; (the deified toad).&nbsp;
&ldquo;A deified toad!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, yes; you know that
on the top of Wa-Ho there is a lake.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We have
just read so in the Itinerary.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, on the
borders of this lake there is a great toad.&nbsp; You can
scarcely ever see him, but you often hear him croaking 100 lis
round.&nbsp; This toad has dwelt on the borders of the lake since
the existence of heaven and earth.&nbsp; As he has never quitted
this solitary spot, he has been deified, and has become the
Spirit of the Mountain.&nbsp; When any one makes a noise and
disturbs the silence of his retreat, he becomes exasperated
against him, and punishes him by overwhelming him with hail and
snow.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You seem to speak quite in earnest; do
you think that a toad can be deified and become a
spirit?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why not, if he makes a point every
night of worshipping the Great Bear?&rdquo;&nbsp; When
Ly-Kouo-Ngan came to his singular system of the Great Bear, it
was futile to reason with him.&nbsp; We contented ourselves with
smiling at him and holding our tongues.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;you laugh at me because I speak of the Seven
Stars; and, indeed, as you do not believe in their influence, it
is wrong in me to speak to you of them.&nbsp; I ought merely to
have told you that the toad of Wa-Ho was deified, because he had
always lived in solitude, on a wild mountain, inaccessible to the
foot of man.&nbsp; Is it not the passions of men that pervert all
the beings of the creation, and prevent them from attaining
perfection?&nbsp; Would not animals in the course of time become
spirits if they did not breathe an air poisoned by the presence
of man?&rdquo;&nbsp; This argument seeming to us somewhat more
philosophical than the first, we vouchsafed the honour of a
serious answer.&nbsp; Ly-Kouo-Ngan, who possessed a fair
judgment, when he was not confused with this Great Bear, doubted
at length the power of the deified toad, and the protection of
Kiang-Kian Mao-Ling.&nbsp; <!-- page 266--><a
name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 266</span>Just as we
were going to repeat our evening prayer, Ly-Kouo-Ngan said to us:
&ldquo;Whatever may be the actual case with the toad and
Kiang-Kian, this is certain, that our journey to-morrow will be
fatiguing and perilous; since you are Lamas of the Lord of
Heaven, pray to him to protect the caravan.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;That is what we do every day,&rdquo; answered we;
&ldquo;but on account of to-morrow&rsquo;s journey, we shall do
so in an especial manner this evening.&rdquo;&nbsp; We had
scarcely slept two hours when one of the soldiers noisily entered
our room, hung on a peg in the wall a large red lantern, and
announced that the cock had already crowed once.&nbsp; We had,
therefore, to rise, and make, with expedition, the preparations
for departure, for we had 150 lis to march before we reached the
next stage.&nbsp; The sky was studded with stars, but the snow
had fallen the evening before in such abundance, that it had
added to former layers another of a foot thick.&nbsp; This was
precisely what we wanted, by way of carpet, to facilitate the
passage of Wa-Ho, a mountain perpetually covered with frozen
snow, almost as slippery as a glacier.</p>
<p>The caravan set out long before daybreak; it advanced slowly
and silently along the tortuous paths of the mountain,
sufficiently lighted up by the whiteness of the snow and the
lustre of the stars.&nbsp; The sun was beginning to tinge the
horizon with red when we reached the plateau.&nbsp; The fear of
the Great Toad having dissipated with the night, every one now
broke the silence to which he had been condemned.&nbsp; First the
guides commenced vituperating the long haired oxen that were
wandering beyond the beaten path.&nbsp; By-and-by the travellers
themselves hazarded some reflections on the mildness of the air
and the unexpected facility of the route.&nbsp; At length we
altogether scorned the anger of the Toad, and every one talked,
hallooed, chattered or sang, without seeming in the least
apprehensive of the fall of snow or hail.&nbsp; Never, perhaps,
had the caravan been so noisy as on this occasion.</p>
<p>The aspect of the plateau of Wa-Ho is extremely melancholy and
monotonous.&nbsp; As far as the eye can reach, nothing is to be
seen but snow; not a single tree, not even a trace of wild
animals, interrupts the monotony of this immense plain.&nbsp;
Only, at intervals, you come to a long pole, blackened by time,
which serves to guide the march of caravans.&nbsp; Throughout
this extended mountain travellers do not find even a place to
prepare their tea and take refreshment.&nbsp; Those who have not
strength enough to pass twenty hours without eating or drinking,
swallow, as they go, a few handfuls of snow, and a little tsamba
previously prepared.</p>
<p>Throughout the day the sky was pure and serene, not a single
cloud obscuring for a moment the rays of the sun.&nbsp; This
excess of fine weather was to us the source of the greatest
suffering; the <!-- page 267--><a name="page267"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 267</span>glare of the snow was so intensely
dazzling, that the hair spectacles did not suffice to keep our
eyes from severe inflammation.</p>
<p>When darkness began to spread over the mountain, we had
reached the edge of the plateau.&nbsp; We descended by a narrow,
rugged path, and after a thousand twistings and turnings in a
deep gorge, we reached at length the stage of Ngenda-Tchai, where
we passed the night in intolerable suffering.&nbsp; Everybody was
continually crying and groaning as though his eyes had been torn
out.&nbsp; Next day it was impossible to proceed.&nbsp; The Lama
Dsiamdchang, who knew something of physic, made a general
distribution of medicine and eye-salve, and we all spent the day
with our eyes bandaged.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Thanks to the drugs of the Lama, the next day we were able to
open our eyes and continue our journey.&nbsp; Three stages
separated us from Tsiamdo; and they were very laborious and
annoying stages, for we were obliged to cross a number of those
odious wooden bridges, suspended over torrents, rivers, and
precipices.&nbsp; The recollection of the recent catastrophe at
Kia-Yu-Kiao haunted us incessantly.&nbsp; After having pursued
for twenty lis a narrow path on the rugged banks of a large river
called the Khiang-Tang-Tchou, we at length reached Tsiamdo.&nbsp;
Thirty-six days had elapsed since our departure from
Lha-Ssa.&nbsp; According to the Chinese Itinerary we had
travelled 2,500 lis (250 leagues.)</p>

<p>The Chinese government has established at Tsiamdo <a
name="citation268"></a><a href="#footnote268"
class="citation">[268]</a> a magazine of provisions, the
management of which is confided to a Liang-Tai.&nbsp; The
garrison is composed of about 300 soldiers and four officers, a
Yeou-Ki, a Tsien-Tsoung, and two Pa-Tsoung.&nbsp; The maintenance
of this military station, and of the garrisons dependent upon it,
amounts annually to the sum of 10,000 ounces of silver.</p>
<p><!-- page 269--><a name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
269</span>Tsiamdo, the capital of the province of Kham, is built
in a valley surrounded by high mountains.&nbsp; Formerly it was
enclosed by a rampart of earth, now broken down every where, and
the remnants of which are taken away every day to repair the
floors of the houses.&nbsp; Tsiamdo, indeed, has little need of
fortifications; it is sufficiently defended by two rivers, the
Dza-Tchou and the Om-Tchou, which, after flowing, the one to the
east, the other to the west of the town, unite on the south, and
form the Ya-Long-Kiang, which crosses, from north to south, the
province of Yun-Nan and Cochin-China, and falls at length into
the sea of China.&nbsp; Two large wooden bridges, one over the
Dza-Tchou, the other over the Om-Tchou, to the right and left of
the town, lead to two parallel roads, the first called the
Sse-Tchouen road, the other the Yun-Nan road.&nbsp; The couriers
who convey the mails from Peking to Lha-Ssa, and all the civil
and military servants of the Chinese government, are obliged to
use the Sse-Tchouen road; that of Yun-Nan is almost
deserted.&nbsp; You only see there, from time to time, a few
Chinese merchants, who purchase, from the Mandarins of their
provinces, the privilege of going to Thibet to sell their
merchandise.</p>
<p>The military stations which the court of Peking has
established in the states of the Tal&eacute;-Lama were at one
time maintained and managed by the joint authorities of
Sse-Tchouen and Yun-Nan.&nbsp; This combination having been, for
a long time, the source of dissensions and quarrels between the
Mandarins of the two provinces, it was determined that the
viceroy of Sse-Tchouen should be sole director of the Chinese
resident in Thibet.</p>
<p>Tsiamdo presents the appearance of an ancient town in decay;
its large houses, constructed with frightful irregularity, are
scattered confusedly over a large tract, leaving on all sides
unoccupied ground or heaps of rubbish.&nbsp; Except a few
buildings of later date, all the rest bear the stamp of great
antiquity.&nbsp; The numerous population you see in the different
quarters of the town are dirty, uncombed, and wallow in profound
idleness.</p>
<p>We could not divine what were the means of existence of the
inhabitants of Tsiamdo; they are without arts, industry, and, we
may add, almost without agriculture.&nbsp; The environs of the
town present, generally speaking, nothing but sands, unfavourable
to the cultivation of corn.&nbsp; They grow, however, some poor
crops of barley, but these are, doubtless, insufficient for the
supply of the country.&nbsp; Possibly musk, skins of wild beasts,
rhubarb, turquoises, and gold-dust, provide the population with
the means of a petty commerce, and thus with the necessaries of
life.</p>
<p>Although Tsiamdo is not a place remarkable for its luxury or
elegance, you admire there a large and magnificent Lamasery <!--
page 270--><a name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
270</span>standing towards the west, on an elevated platform
which commands the rest of the town.&nbsp; It is inhabited by
about 2,000 Lamas, who, instead of each having his small house,
as in the other Buddhic monasteries, live all together in the
large buildings, with which the principal temple is
surrounded.&nbsp; The sumptuous decorations that ornament this
temple make it regarded as one of the finest and most wealthy in
Thibet.&nbsp; The Lamasery of Tsiamdo has for its ecclesiastical
superior a Houtouktou Lama, who is at the same time temporal
sovereign of the whole province of Kham.</p>
<p>Five lis from Tsiamdo, towards the frontiers of China, there
is a town called Djaya, which, with the countries dependent on
it, is subject to a Grand Lama, bearing the title of
Tchaktchouba.&nbsp; This Lamanesque dignity is somewhat inferior
to that of Houtouktou.&nbsp; At the time we were in Thibet, there
arose a great contest between the Houtouktou of Tsiamdo and the
Tchaktchouba of Djaya.&nbsp; The latter, a young, bold, and
enterprising Lama, had declared himself Houtouktou, in virtue of
an old diploma, which he affirmed had been granted to him, in one
of his former lives, by the Tal&eacute;-Lama.&nbsp; He asserted,
accordingly, his rights to supremacy, and claimed the see of
Tsiamdo and the government of the province of Kham.&nbsp; The
Houtouktou of Tsiamdo, a Lama advanced in years, did not choose
to resign his authority, and, on his side, alleged authentic
titles, sent by the court of Peking, and confirmed by the Grand
Lama of Lha-Ssa.&nbsp; All the tribes, and all the Lamaseries of
the province, entered into this quarrel, and took part, some with
the young Lama, some with the old.&nbsp; After long and futile
discussions, written and verbal, they resorted to arms, and for a
full year these wild and fanatic tribes were engaged in bloody
conflicts.&nbsp; Whole villages were destroyed, and their
inhabitants cut in pieces.&nbsp; In their terrible fury, these
ferocious combatants devastated everything; they pursued into the
desert, with arrows and fusils, the herds of goats and
long-haired oxen, and in their destructive course, set fire to
the forests they found on their way.</p>
<p>When we arrived at Tsiamdo, the war had ceased some days, and
all parties had consented to a truce, in hopes of effecting a
reconciliation.&nbsp; Thibetian and Chinese negotiators had been
sent by the Tal&eacute;-Lama and the ambassador Ki-Chan
conjointly.&nbsp; The youthful Houtouktou of Djaya had been
summoned to this congress, and fearful of treachery, he had come
with a formidable escort of his bravest partisans.&nbsp; Several
conferences had been held without producing any satisfactory
result.&nbsp; Neither the one nor the other of the two pretenders
would withdraw his claims; the parties were irreconcilable, and
everything presaged that the war would be soon resumed with fresh
fury.&nbsp; It appeared to us that the party of the <!-- page
271--><a name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
271</span>young Houtouktou had every chance of success, because
it was the most national, and consequently the most popular and
strongest.&nbsp; Not that his title was really better founded or
more valid than that of his competitor, but it was easy to see
that the old Houtouktou of Tsiamdo had hurt the pride of his
tribes by invoking the arbitration of the Chinese, and relying
upon the aid of the government of Peking.&nbsp; All foreign
intervention is odious and detestable.&nbsp; This is truth, alike
in Europe and in the mountains of Thibet, wherever people care
for their independence and their dignity.</p>
<p>Our residence at Tsiamdo was quite exempt from the irritation
and rage that reigned about us.&nbsp; We were treated with all
those marks of attention and kindness which we had experienced on
all our journey since our departure from Lha-Ssa.&nbsp; Both the
young and the old Houtouktou sent us a scarf of blessing, with a
good provision of butter and quarters of mutton.</p>
<p>We stayed at Tsiamdo three days; for our guide, the
Pacificator of Kingdoms, had great need of rest.&nbsp; The
fatigues of this arduous route had sensibly affected his
health.&nbsp; His legs were so swollen that he could not mount or
dismount from his horse without the assistance of several
persons.&nbsp; The physicians and sorcerers of Tsiamdo, whom he
consulted, gave answers, the clearest meaning of which was, that
if the malady diminished, it would be no great matter; but that
if it should grow worse, it might become a serious affair.&nbsp;
The most reasonable counsellors advised Ly-Kouo-Ngan to continue
his journey in a palanquin.&nbsp; A Chinese Mandarin of the place
offered to sell him his own, and to engage carriers.&nbsp; This
advice was perfectly prudent; but avarice interposed, and the
sick man protested that he should be more fatigued in a palanquin
than on horseback.</p>
<p>To the illness of Ly-Kouo-Ngan was added another source of
delay.&nbsp; A Chinese caravan which had left Lha-Ssa a few days
after us, had arrived at Tsiamdo on the same evening with
ourselves.&nbsp; This caravan consisted of a Liang-Tai, or
commissary, of his son, a young man of eighteen, and of a
numerous suite of soldiers and servants.&nbsp; We wanted to let
these pass on before, for, if we travelled in company, it was to
be feared that we should not find lodgings and oulah sufficient
for so great a number.&nbsp; The Liang-Tai and his son travelled
in palanquins; but, notwithstanding the conveniences of this mode
of conveyance, the two illustrious travellers were so extenuated
with fatigue, and so languid, that it was the general impression
their strength would not suffice to carry them into China.&nbsp;
The literary Mandarins being used to an easy life, are little
adapted for supporting the innumerable miseries of the journey
into Thibet.&nbsp; <!-- page 272--><a name="page272"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 272</span>Among those who are sent to fulfil
the duties of commissary, few are fortunate enough to return to
their country.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>The day of our departure, the old Houtouktou of Tsiamdo sent
us an escort of four Thibetian horsemen, to guard us until we
reached the territory of the Tchaktchouba of Djaya.&nbsp; On
quitting the town, we passed over a magnificent bridge entirely
built of large trunks of fir, and we then found ourselves on the
Sse-Tchouen road, which meanders along the sides of a high
mountain, at the base of which runs the rapid river
Dza-Tchou.&nbsp; After proceeding twenty lis, we met, at a turn
of the mountain, in a deep and retired gorge, a little party of
travellers, who presented a picture full of poetry: The
procession was opened by a Thibetian woman astride a fine donkey,
and carrying an infant, solidly fastened to her shoulders by
large leathern straps.&nbsp; She led after her, by a long cord, a
pack-horse, laden with two panniers, which hung symmetrically on
its sides.&nbsp; These two panniers served as lodgings for two
children, whose laughing joyous faces we saw peeping out from
little windows in their respective baskets.&nbsp; The difference
in the age of these children seemed slight; but they could not be
of the same weight, for to keep the equilibrium between them, a
large <!-- page 273--><a name="page273"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 273</span>stone was tied to the side of one of
the panniers.&nbsp; Behind the horse laden with these child-boxes
followed a horseman, whom one easily recognised, by his costume,
as a retired Chinese soldier.&nbsp; He had behind him, on the
crupper, a boy of twelve years old.&nbsp; Last of all, an
enormous red-haired dog, with squinting eyes, and an expression
altogether of decided bad temper, completed this singular
caravan, which joined us, and took advantage of our company as
far as the province of Sse-Tchouen.</p>
<p>The Chinese was an ex-soldier of the garrison of
Tsiamdo.&nbsp; Having performed the three years&rsquo; service
required by law, he had obtained leave to remain in Thibet, and
to engage in commerce.&nbsp; He had married, and after having
amassed a little fortune, he was returning to his country with
all his family.</p>
<p>We could not but admire the fortitude, the energy, and the
devotion of this brave Chinese, so different from his selfish
countrymen, who never scruple to leave their wives and children
in foreign lands.&nbsp; He had to bear up, not only against the
dangers and fatigues of a long journey, but also against the
raillery of those who themselves had not the heart to follow his
good example.&nbsp; The soldiers of our escort soon began to turn
him into ridicule.&nbsp; &ldquo;This man,&rdquo; said they,
&ldquo;is evidently insane; to bring from foreign countries money
and merchandise, that is reasonable; but to bring into the
central nation, a large-footed woman and all these little
barbarians, why, it is contrary to all established usages.&nbsp;
Has the fellow an idea of making money by exhibiting these
animals of Thibet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>More than once observations of this kind excited our
indignation.&nbsp; We always made a point of defending this
worthy father, of commending his honourable conduct, and of
reproving loudly the barbarity and immorality of the Chinese
customs.</p>
<p>Shortly after we had admitted into our caravan the interesting
little party from Tsiamdo, we left the river Dza-Tchou to our
right, and ascended a high mountain covered with large trees and
enormous rocks, themselves covered with thick coats of
lichen.&nbsp; We afterwards again came upon the river, and
proceeded along its banks, by a rugged path, for a few lis, till
we arrived at Meng-Phou.&nbsp; We had travelled scarcely eight
leagues, but we were overcome with fatigue.&nbsp; The three days
rest we had taken at Tsiamdo had modified our equestrian powers,
so that we had some difficulty in getting our legs into riding
order again.&nbsp; Meng-Phou consists of seven or eight huts,
built of rough stone, in a large and deep ravine.</p>
<p>Next day we travelled along the crest of a lofty mountain,
having continually to mount and dismount, in order to get from
one <!-- page 274--><a name="page274"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 274</span>eminence to another.&nbsp; On this
route we had frequently to cross precipices on wooden bridges,
which, to use the expression of the Chinese Itinerary, are
&ldquo;suspended in the region of the clouds.&rdquo;&nbsp; After
a march of 60 lis we reached Pao-Tun, where we changed the oulah,
and where we began to find the Thibetians less complaisant and
docile than on the other side of Tsiamdo.&nbsp; Their mien was
haughtier and their manner more abrupt.&nbsp; On the other hand,
the Chinese of the caravan became more humble, less exacting, and
prudently abstained from speaking in a domineering fashion.&nbsp;
All the way from Pao-Tun to Bagoung, you see nothing for ten
leagues but calcareous mountains, entirely bare and rough.&nbsp;
No trees are to be seen, nor grass, nor even moss.&nbsp; Below
you only remark, in the fissures of the rocks, a little verdant
stone-crop, which seems to protest against the desolate sterility
around.&nbsp; One of these mountains, which the Chinese call
Khou-Loung-Chan, which means the perforated mountain, presents a
very singular appearance.&nbsp; You see here a great number of
holes and hollows, in infinite variety of form and size.&nbsp;
Some of these apertures resemble huge doorways.&nbsp; The smaller
look like bells, some like round and oval sky lights.</p>
<p>The mountain being in the peak form, we were not able to go
and visit these caverns.&nbsp; However, we approached
sufficiently near to them to be able to judge that they are all
of a considerable depth.&nbsp; These numerous cavities resulting,
probably, from old volcanic eruptions, are attributed by the
Chinese to the Kouei or evil genii.&nbsp; The Thibetians, on the
contrary, affirm that they were dug by the tutelary deities of
the country; that, in ancient times, some Lamas of great sanctity
made them their retreat, and that therein they were transformed
into Buddha; and that at certain periods of the year you still
hear within the mountain the murmur of Lama prayers.</p>
<p>In Thibet, we had never observed on our route other mountains
than those of a granitic nature, always remarkable for masses of
enormous stones, heaped upon one another, generally assuming a
form originally quadrangular, but rounded at the angles by the
incessant action of the wind and rain.&nbsp; These enormous
calcareous masses, which we observed on our way to Bagoung, could
not fail to fix our attention.&nbsp; In fact, the country began
entirely to change its aspect.&nbsp; For more than a fortnight we
saw nothing but calcareous mountains, producing a marble as white
as snow, of a fine and very close grain.&nbsp; The shepherds of
these regions are in the habit of cutting from them large slabs,
on which they carve the image of Buddha, or the formula &ldquo;Om
mani padme houm,&rdquo; and which they afterwards place on the
roadside.&nbsp; These carvings remain for many years, without
being in the least defaced, for this <!-- page 275--><a
name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 275</span>marble
having a great quantity of silex closely intermixed with
carbonate of chalk, is extremely hard.&nbsp; Before our arrival
at Bagoung, we journeyed for four or five lis, along a road
bordered on both sides, by two unbroken lines of these Buddhic
inscriptions.&nbsp; We saw some Lamas engraving the <i>mani</i>
on marble slabs.</p>
<p>We reached the little village of Bagoung a little before
nightfall, and proceeded to dismount at a Chinese barracks,
composed of a few huts built of magnificent fragments of white
marble, cemented with mud and dung.&nbsp; As soon as we arrived,
they announced to us the death of the Liang-Tai, named Pei, who
had overtaken us at Tsiamdo.&nbsp; It was two days before, that
his caravan had passed through Bagoung.&nbsp; Having reached the
barracks, the bearers of the Mandarin, after setting down the
palanquin, had opened the curtains, as usual, to invite his
excellency to enter the apartment that had been prepared for
him.&nbsp; But, in the palanquin, they only found a corpse.&nbsp;
In accordance with the Chinese usages, the son of the departed
could not leave the body of his father in a foreign land, but
must take it to his family, in order to deposit it in the
sepulchre of his ancestors.&nbsp; Now, we were still in the heart
of Thibet, and the family of the Mandarin Pei was in the province
of Tche-Kiang, altogether at the extremity of China.&nbsp; The
route, as has been seen, was difficult and long; but hesitation
in the matter was out of the question: filial piety had to
surmount all obstacles.&nbsp; A coffin, ready made, was, by
chance, in the guardhouse.&nbsp; The son of the Mandarin bought
it at a high price from the soldiers; he deposited therein the
remains of his father.&nbsp; They adapted the shafts of the
palanquin to the coffin, and the carriers, in consideration of
increased pay, agreed to carry to the frontiers of China, a dead
instead of a living man.&nbsp; The caravan had quitted Bagoung
the evening preceding our arrival.</p>
<p>The announcement of this death astonished and affected all of
us.</p>
<p>Ly-Kouo-Ngan particularly, who was in no satisfactory state of
mind, was thunderstruck.&nbsp; The fear he felt prevented him
from taking any supper; but, in the evening, another matter
occurred to divert his attention from these sad thoughts of
death.&nbsp; The chief of the Thibetian village came to the
guard-house, to announce to the travellers, that it had been
resolved in that country, that thereafter they would not supply
the oulah gratuitously; that for a horse, people must pay one
ounce of silver, and for a yak half an ounce.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
caravan which passed yesterday,&rdquo; added he, &ldquo;was
obliged to agree to this.&rdquo; . . .&nbsp; To make it manifest
that this regulation would not admit of any discussion, he
abruptly put his tongue in his cheek at us, and withdrew.</p>
<p><!-- page 276--><a name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
276</span>A manifesto so plain and definite was a complete
thunderbolt to the Pacificator of Kingdoms.&nbsp; He entirely
forgot the melancholy death of the poor Liang-Tai, in the thought
of this frightful catastrophe which threatened his purse.&nbsp;
We charitably participated in his affliction, and tried, as well
as we could, to conform our words to his sombre thoughts.&nbsp;
But, in reality, it was a matter of utter indifference to
us.&nbsp; If they refused to supply us with the means of
continuing our journey, we should merely have to stay in Thibet,
which, after all, was a result to which we should without
difficulty become reconciled.&nbsp; Meantime, we went to bed, and
left the people of the escort to discuss politics and social
economy.</p>
<p>The next day, when we rose, we found neither oxen nor horses
in the court of the barracks.&nbsp; Ly-Kouo-Ngan was in utter
despair.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shall we have the oulah?&rdquo; inquired
we; &ldquo;shall we depart to-day?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;These
barbarians,&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;do not comprehend the
merit of obedience.&nbsp; I have resolved to address myself to
Proul-Tamba; I have sent a deputation to him; I have known him a
long time, and I hope he will procure the oulah for
us.&rdquo;&nbsp; This Proul-Tamba was a person of whom we had
already heard a great deal.&nbsp; He was at the head of the party
of the young Tchaktchouba of Djaya, and consequently the avowed
enemy of Chinese influence.&nbsp; He was, we were informed,
learned as the most learned Lamas of Lha-Ssa.&nbsp; No one came
up to him in valour; never in battle had he experienced
defeat.&nbsp; Accordingly, among all the tribes of the province
of Kham, his name alone had potency, and acted like a talisman on
the minds of the multitude.&nbsp; Proul-Tamba was, in some
measure, the Abd-el-Kader of these wild mountaineers.</p>
<p>The dwelling of Proul-Tamba was distant from Bagoung not more
than five or six lis.&nbsp; The deputation that had been sent to
him, soon returned, and announced that the great chief himself
was coming.&nbsp; This unexpected news put in commotion the whole
Thibetian village, and the soldiers.&nbsp; Every one said to
every one, excitedly, &ldquo;The great chief is coming, we are
going to see the great chief!&rdquo;&nbsp; Ly-Kouo-Ngan hastened
to attire himself in his best clothes, his silk boots, and his
hat of ceremony.&nbsp; The Chinese soldiers also improved, as
well as they could, their toilet.&nbsp; Whilst the Thibetians ran
to meet their chief, Ly-Kouo-Ngan selected from his baggage a
magnificent khata, or scarf of blessing, and then posted himself
on the threshold of the door, to receive the illustrious
Proul-Tamba.&nbsp; As for us, the department we selected was to
study the physiognomies of the different parties.&nbsp; The most
interesting was, doubtless, that of the Pacificator of
Kingdoms.&nbsp; It was curious to see this Chinese Mandarin,
generally so haughtily <!-- page 277--><a
name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 277</span>insolent in
the presence of Thibetians, become all at once humble and modest,
and awaiting, tremblingly, the arrival of a man whom he deemed
strong and potent.</p>
<p>At last the great chief appeared; he was on horseback,
escorted by a guard of honour, consisting of four horsemen.&nbsp;
As soon as all had dismounted, the Pacificator of Kingdoms
approached Proul-Tamba, made him a low bow, and offered him the
scarf of blessing.&nbsp; Proul-Tamba motioned to one of his
attendants to receive the present, and without saying a word,
quickly crossed the court, and went straight to the room prepared
for his reception, and where we awaited him with the Lama
Dchiamdchang.&nbsp; Proul-Tamba made us a slight bow, and sat
down without ceremony, in the place of honour, on a carpet of
grey felt.&nbsp; Ly-Kouo-Ngan placed himself on his left, the
Lama Dchiamdchang on his right, and we in front of him.&nbsp;
Between us five there was such a respectful distance, that we
formed a sort of large circle.&nbsp; Some Chinese soldiers and a
crowd of Thibetians stood behind us.</p>
<p>There was a minute of profound silence.&nbsp; The great chief
Proul-Tamba was at most forty years of age; he was of middle
height, and his sole attire was a large robe of green silk,
bordered with beautiful wolf-fur, and fastened at the waist by a
red girdle.&nbsp; Large purple leather boots, an alarming
fox-skin cap, and a broad, long sabre, passed through the girdle
horizontally, completed his costume.&nbsp; Long hair, black as
ebony, which hung down over his shoulders, gave to his pale, thin
face, a marked expression of energy.&nbsp; The eyes were,
however, the most remarkable features in the physiognomy of this
man; they were large, glittering, and seemed to breathe
indomitable courage and pride.&nbsp; The whole appearance and
bearing of Proul-Tamba denoted a man of real superiority, born to
command his fellows.&nbsp; After having attentively looked at us,
one after the other, his hands resting one on each end of his
sabre, he drew from his bosom a packet of little khatas, and had
them distributed amongst us by one of his men.&nbsp; Then turning
to Ly-Kouo-Ngan: &ldquo;Ah, thou art back again,&rdquo; said he,
with a voice that resounded like a bell; &ldquo;if they had not
told me this morning it was thee, I should not have recognised
thee.&nbsp; How thou hast aged since thy last visit to
Bagoung.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, thou art right,&rdquo; answered
the Pacificator of Kingdoms, in soft and insinuating tones,
drawing himself along the felt carpet nearer to his interlocutor;
&ldquo;yes, I am very feeble; but thou art more vigorous than
ever.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We live in circumstances under which it
is necessary to be vigorous; there is no longer peace in our
mountains.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;True, I heard yonder that you have
had here amongst you a little dispute.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;For
more than a year past, the tribes of Kham <!-- page 278--><a
name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 278</span>have been
waging a bloody war, and thou callest that a little
dispute.&nbsp; Thou hast only to open thy eyes, on thy way, and
thou wilt behold, on every side, villages in ruins, and forests
burnt down.&nbsp; In a few days, we shall be obliged to resume
our work, for no one will hear the words of peace.&nbsp; The war,
indeed, might have been brought to a conclusion after a few
skirmishes; but, since you Chinese have chosen to meddle in our
affairs, the parties have become irreconcilable.&nbsp; You
Chinese Mandarins are good for nothing but to bring disorder and
confusion into these countries.&nbsp; It cannot go on in this
way.&nbsp; We have let you alone for some time, and now your
audacity knows no bounds.&nbsp; I cannot, without shuddering all
over, think of that affair of the Nomekhan of Lha-Ssa.&nbsp; They
pretend that the Nomekhan committed great crimes.&nbsp; It is
false: these great crimes, it is you that invented them.&nbsp;
The Nomekhan is a saint, a Living Buddha.&nbsp; Who ever heard
that a Living Buddha could be tried and exiled by Ki-Chan, a
Chinese, a layman?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The order came from the
Grand Emperor,&rdquo; answered Ly-Kouo-Ngan, in a low and
tremulous voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Grand Emperor!&rdquo; cried
Proul-Tamba, turning with an angry air to his interrupter,
&ldquo;thy Grand Emperor is only a layman.&nbsp; What is thy
Grand Emperor compared with a Grand Lama, a Living
Buddha?&rdquo;&nbsp; The great chief of the province of Kham
inveighed for a length of time against the domination of the
Chinese in Thibet.&nbsp; He assailed in turns the Emperor, the
viceroy of Sse-Tchouen, and the ambassador of Lha-Ssa.</p>
<p>Throughout these energetic philippics, he frequently reverted
to the affair of the Nomekhan.&nbsp; One could see that he felt a
deep interest in the fate of the Grand Lama, whom he regarded as
a victim of the court of Peking.&nbsp; The Pacificator of
Kingdoms took care not to contradict him; he affected to concur
in the sentiments of Proul-Tamba, and received each proposition
with an inclination of the head.&nbsp; At length he hazarded a
word as to departure and the oulah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The oulah,&rdquo; replied Proul-Tamba;
&ldquo;henceforth, there will be none for the Chinese, unless
they pay the price for them.&nbsp; It is enough that we allow the
Chinese to penetrate into our country, without adding the folly
of furnishing them with the oulah gratuitously.&nbsp; However, as
thou art an old acquaintance, we will make an exception in favour
of thy caravan.&nbsp; Besides, thou art conducting two Lamas of
the Western Heaven, who have been recommended to me by the chief
Kalon of Lha-Ssa, and who are entitled to my services.&nbsp;
Where is the Dheba of Bagoung?&nbsp; Let him advance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The individual who, the evening before, had come to tell us,
<!-- page 279--><a name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
279</span>&ldquo;no more money, no more oulah,&rdquo; presented
himself.&nbsp; He bent his knee before the great chief, and
respectfully put his tongue in his cheek at him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let
them get ready the oulah immediately,&rdquo; cried Proul-Tamba,
&ldquo;and let every one do his duty.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
Thibetians, who were in the courtyard, sent forth a simultaneous
shout of submission, and ran off to the adjacent village.</p>
<p>Proul-Tamba rose, and after having invited us to take tea in
his house, which stood on our road, sprang on his horse, and
returned home at full gallop.&nbsp; The oulah soon appeared, and
the caravan found itself organised, as it were, by magic.&nbsp;
After half an hour&rsquo;s march, we reached the residence of the
great chief.&nbsp; It was a lofty, large structure, not unlike a
stronghold of the feudal times.&nbsp; A broad canal, bordered
with large trees, encircled it.&nbsp; A drawbridge descended for
us.&nbsp; We dismounted to cross it, and entered, through an
immense gateway, a square court, where my lord Proul-Tamba
awaited us.&nbsp; They tied the horses to posts planted in the
middle of the court, and we were introduced into a vast saloon,
which seemed to serve as the domestic temple, or castle
chapel.&nbsp; The enormous beams which supported the roof were
entirely gilt.&nbsp; The walls were hung with flags of all
colours, covered with Thibetian inscriptions.&nbsp; At the end of
the saloon were three colossal statues of Buddha, before which
were placed large butter lamps and censers.&nbsp; In a corner of
the temple, they had prepared a low table, with four thick
cushions, covered with red stuff.&nbsp; Proul-Tamba graciously
invited us to take our places, and as soon as we were seated, the
chatelaine made her appearance in state costume, that is to say,
with her face frightfully daubed over with black, her copious
tresses adorned with spangles, red coral beads, and small
mother-of pearl buttons.</p>
<p>In her right hand she carried a majestic tea-pot, the vast
circumference of which rested on her left arm.&nbsp; Each of us
presented his cup, which was filled with a bumper of tea, on the
surface of which floated a thick coat of butter: the tea was of
the best quality.&nbsp; While we were sipping the hot fluid, our
hostess reappeared, bearing two dishes of gilt wood, the one full
of raisins, the other of nuts.&nbsp; &ldquo;These are fruits of
our country,&rdquo; said Proul-Tamba to us; &ldquo;they grow in a
fine valley not far distant.&nbsp; In the Western Heaven, have
you fruits of this kind?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, yes,
plentifully; and you cannot conceive how much pleasure you give
us in presenting to us these fruits, for they recall to us our
country,&rdquo; and, as we spoke, we took a handful of raisins
from the gilt plate.&nbsp; Unfortunately, they were only
remarkable for a tough and sour skin, and for a number of pips,
which cracked under our teeth <!-- page 280--><a
name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 280</span>like
gravel.&nbsp; We turned to the nuts, which were of a magnificent
size, but were again deceived; the kernel was so solidly fixed in
its hard shell, that it was as much as we could do to extract a
few morsels with the tips of our nails.&nbsp; We returned to the
raisins, then again to the nuts, travelling from one plate to the
other in search, but vainly, of something wherewith to quiet the
gnawings of our stomach.&nbsp; We were growing convinced that
Mrs. Proul-Tamba had resolved to play us a trick, when we saw two
vigorous Thibetians approach, carrying another table, on which
was a whole kid, and a superb haunch of venison.&nbsp; This
unexpected apparition gladdened our hearts, and an involuntary
smile must have announced to our Amphitryon how favourably his
second service was received.&nbsp; They removed the skins of
raisins and the nut shells; Thibetian beer took the place of the
buttered tea, and we set to work with incomparable energy.&nbsp;
When we had triumphantly achieved this Homeric repast, we offered
to the grand chief a scarf of blessing, and remounted our
horses.&nbsp; Not far from the feudal castle of the illustrious
Proul-Tamba, we came to a calcareous hill, with great apertures
on its summit, and on its rugged sides numerous Buddhic sentences
cut in gigantic characters.&nbsp; All the Thibetians stopped, and
prostrated themselves thrice to the ground.&nbsp; This mountain
was the retreat of a hermit Lama, for whom all the tribes of the
province of Kham entertained profound veneration.&nbsp; According
to the statement of the natives, this holy Lama had withdrawn,
twenty-two years before, to one of the caverns of the mountain;
since that time, he had remained in it, without quitting it once,
passing day and night in prayer, and in the contemplation of the
ten thousand virtues of Buddha.&nbsp; He allowed no one to visit
him.&nbsp; Every three years, however, he gave a grand audience
of eight days, and, during that period, the devout might present
themselves freely at his cell, and consult him about things past,
present, and to come.&nbsp; At this time, large offerings failed
not to pour in from every quarter: the sainted Lama kept none for
himself, but distributed them among the poor of the
district.&nbsp; What did he want with riches and the good things
of this world?&nbsp; His cell, dug out of the living rock, never
required the least repair; his yellow robe, lined with sheepskin,
served him alike in all seasons of the year.&nbsp; On every sixth
day only did he take a repast, consisting of a little tea and
barley-meal, which charitable persons in the vicinity passed to
him by means of a long cord, which descended from the top of the
grotto to the foot of the mountain.&nbsp; <!-- page 281--><a
name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 281</span>Several
Lamas had placed themselves under the direction of this hermit,
and had resolved to adopt his manner of life.&nbsp; They dwelt in
cells, dug near that of their master.&nbsp; The most celebrated
of his disciples was the father of the great Proul-Tamba.&nbsp;
He, also, had been a famous warrior, and ever at the head of the
people of this country.&nbsp; Having reached an advanced age, and
seeing his son capable of being his successor, he had conferred
on him the title of Grand Chief.&nbsp; Then shaving his head, and
assuming the sacred habit of the Lamas, he had retired into
solitude, leaving to younger and more vigorous hands the charge
of terminating the contest which had commenced between the two
Houtouktous of the province of Kham.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The sun had not set when we reached the station of Wang-Tsa,
fifty lis from Bagoung.&nbsp; Wang-Tsa is a small village built
at the foot of a hill of black loam, covered with thickets of
holly and <!-- page 282--><a name="page282"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 282</span>cypress.&nbsp; The houses, built of
the black soil, communicate to the village an extremely sombre
and funereal aspect.&nbsp; At Wang-Tsa, we began to observe
traces of the civil war, which was laying waste these
countries.&nbsp; The Chinese barracks, built of large fir planks,
had been entirely burnt; its remains, half charred, which lay
about, served throughout the evening to keep up a magnificent
fire.&nbsp; Upon setting out next morning, we observed a singular
alteration in the caravan.&nbsp; The horses and oxen were the
same that we had taken from Bagoung, but all the Thibetian guides
had vanished; not one of them remained: women of Wang-Tsa had
taken their place.&nbsp; Upon inquiring the meaning of this new
and surprising arrangement: &ldquo;To-day,&rdquo; answered the
Lama Dchiamdchang, &ldquo;we shall reach Gaya, which is a hostile
village.&nbsp; If the Bagoung men went there, there would
inevitably be a fight, and the inhabitants of Gaya would seize
the animals of the caravan.&nbsp; The oulah being conducted by
women, we have nothing to fear.&nbsp; Men, who would have the
cowardice to fight with women, and take the animals confided to
their care, would be despised by the whole world.&nbsp; Such is
the usage of these countries.&rdquo;&nbsp; We were not a little
surprised to find, among the wild mountains of Thibet, sentiments
so like those of our own country.&nbsp; This was pure French
chivalry.&nbsp; We were eager to see in what courteous and
gallant fashion the ladies of Wang-Tsa would be received by the
gentlemen of Gaya.</p>
<p>After passing a lofty mountain, covered with large masses of
rock, partly buried in old layers of snow, we entered a valley
thoroughly cultivated, and of a mild temperature.&nbsp; We
perceived in the distance, in a hollow, the houses of Gaya.&nbsp;
They were high, flanked with watch-towers, and not unlike
castles.&nbsp; When we were some hundred paces from this large
village, there issued from it all at once a formidable squadron
of cavalry, who dashed forward to meet the caravan.&nbsp; The
horsemen, armed with fusils and long lances, seemed quite
disposed for a skirmish.&nbsp; Their martial humour, however,
vanished, when they perceived that the caravan was conducted by
women; and they contented themselves with hearty shouts of
laughter, and with expressions of contempt at the cowardice of
their foes.&nbsp; As we entered Gaya, men, women, and children,
were all in motion, and sending forth cries, that seemed to us
anything but amicable.&nbsp; No mischance, however,
occurred.&nbsp; We dismounted in the court of a large
three-storied house, and as soon as they had unsaddled the
horses, and unyoked the long-haired oxen, the ladies of Wang-Tsa
drank hastily a cup of buttered tea, which was courteously handed
round to each, and immediately returned with their oulah.</p>
<p>We found at Gaya a tolerably comfortable lodging, but we did
<!-- page 283--><a name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
283</span>not know on what conditions we should proceed.&nbsp;
The important question of the oulah occupied every one&rsquo;s
mind, yet no one ventured to put the question openly, and we went
to bed, leaving the consideration of serious matters to the
morrow.</p>
<p>It was scarce day when the court of the house where we lodged
was filled with a crowd of Thibetians, who had come to deliberate
on the degree in which they should tax our caravan.&nbsp; From a
second-floor balcony, we could enjoy at our leisure the singular
spectacle which this council presented.&nbsp; Of the immense
multitude, there was not an individual who was not an orator;
everybody spoke at once; and, judging from the sounding altitude
of the voices, and the impetuous animation of the gestures, there
must certainly have been some very fine speeches there.&nbsp;
Some orators mounted upon the luggage that was piled in the
court, and made of it a pulpit, whence they overlooked the
multitude.&nbsp; Sometimes it seemed that the eloquence of words
was insufficient to convey conviction to the minds of the
audience, for the disputants would fight and pull each
other&rsquo;s hair, and beat each other without mercy, until an
orator of superior influence came and called the honourable
members to order.&nbsp; This calm, however, would not be of long
duration; the tumult and disorder would soon recommence with
increased vigour.&nbsp; The thing became so serious, that we were
convinced these people would end with drawing their sabres, and
massacring each other.&nbsp; We were mistaken.&nbsp; After the
assembly had vociferated, gesticulated, and manipulated for more
than an hour, there was a great shout of laughter; the council
rose, and everybody withdrew perfectly calm.&nbsp; Two deputies
then ascended to the second-floor, where the staff of the caravan
lodged; and informed Ly-Kouo-Ngan, that the chiefs of the family
of Gaya, after deliberating on the organisation of the oulah, had
decided that they would furnish gratuitously animals for the two
Lamas of the Western Heaven, and for the Thibetians of Lha-Ssa;
but that the Chinese must pay half-an-ounce of silver for a
horse, and a quarter for a long-haired ox.&nbsp; At this
intimation, Ly-Kouo-Ngan collected his strength, and inveighed
with energy against what he called a tyranny, an injustice.&nbsp;
The Chinese soldiers of the caravan, who were present,
co-operated with loud cries and menaces, for the purpose of
intimidating the delegates of the national assembly of Gaya; but
the latter preserved an attitude deliciously haughty and
contemptuous.&nbsp; One of them advanced a step, placed, with a
sort of wild dignity, his right hand on the shoulder of
Ly-Kouo-Ngan, and after piercing him with his great black eyes,
shaded with thick eyebrows, &ldquo;Man of China,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;listen to me; dost thou think that with an inhabitant of
the valley of Gaya, there is much <!-- page 284--><a
name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 284</span>difference
between cutting off the head of a Chinese and that of a
goat?&nbsp; Tell thy soldiers, then, not to be too fierce, and
not to talk big words.&nbsp; Who ever saw the fox that could
terrify the terrible yak of the mountains?&nbsp; The oulah will
be ready presently; if you do not take it, and go to-day,
to-morrow the price will be doubled.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Chinese
perceiving that violence would only involve disagreeable results,
had recourse to cajolery, but to no purpose.&nbsp; Ly-Kouo-Ngan
found no resource except that of opening his strong-box, and
weighing out the required sum.&nbsp; The oulah soon arrived, and
we occupied ourselves busily with the organisation of the
caravan, in order to leave as soon as possible this village of
Gaya, which the Chinese deemed barbarous and inhabitable, but
which seemed to us extremely picturesque.</p>
<p>From Gaya to Angti, where we were to change the oulah, was
only a short stage of thirty lis.&nbsp; The Chinese were in
despair at having been obliged to spend so much money to effect
so short a distance; but they had only come to the commencement
of their miseries; for we were destined to meet with Thibetian
tribes, still less tractable than those of Gaya.</p>
<p>The snow, which had given us a few days&rsquo; respite since
our departure from Tsiamdo, again assailed us on the very evening
of our arrival at Angti.&nbsp; During the night, and the
following day, it fell in such abundance that we were unable to
go out without having it up to our knees.&nbsp; As a climax of
misfortune, we had, on leaving Angti, to ascend one of the rugged
and most dangerous mountains on this route.&nbsp; The Chinese
Itinerary thus describes it: &ldquo;At Angti, you cross a great
snow-clad mountain; the road is very steep; the accumulated snows
resemble a silvery vapour.&nbsp; The fog which the mountain
exhales penetrates the body, and makes the Chinese
ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to a popular tradition of the country, in the olden
time, a chief of the tribe of Angti, a famous warrior, held in
awe by all his neighbours, was buried under an avalanche one day
when he was crossing the mountain.&nbsp; All the efforts to
recover his body were fruitless.&nbsp; A holy Lama of the period,
having declared that the chief had become the genius of the
mountain, they raised a temple to him, which still exists, and
where travellers never fail to burn a few incense sticks, before
proceeding on their way.&nbsp; In tempests, when the wind blows
with violence, the genius of Mount Angti never fails to appear;
there is no one about who has not seen him several times.&nbsp;
He is always seen mounted upon a red horse, clothed in large
white robes, and quietly sauntering upon the crest of the
mountain.&nbsp; If he meets any traveller, he takes him on his
crupper, and vanishes forthwith at full gallop.&nbsp; The red
horse <!-- page 285--><a name="page285"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 285</span>being so light that he leaves no
trace, even on the snow, no one, to this day, has been able to
discover the retreat of the White Knight, for so they call him in
the country.</p>
<p>As to us, we were not much concerned about the red horse and
the white knight.&nbsp; What we feared, was the mountain
itself.&nbsp; We could not help shuddering at the sight of the
frightful quantity of snow which had fallen, and which would
render the road extremely dangerous.&nbsp; We were obliged to
await the return of fine weather, and then to send, as we had
before done under similar circumstances, a herd of long-haired
oxen to trample down the snow, and trace out a path over the
mountain.</p>
<p>We stayed five days at Angti.&nbsp; Ly-Kouo-Ngan took
advantage of this long halt to doctor his legs, the malady in
which assumed every day a more alarming character.&nbsp; The
question of the oulah, long discussed in several assemblies, was
resolved, at last, in the same way as at Gaya; a result which did
not fail greatly to annoy the Chinese, and to elicit from them
infinite clamour.</p>
<p>What we found most remarkable at Angti was, certainly, the
Dheba, or chief of the tribe.&nbsp; This individual, named Bomba,
was at most three feet high; the sabre which he carried in his
girdle was, at least, twice his own length; notwithstanding this,
the man had a magnificent chest, and a face, broad, energetic in
its expression, and beautifully regular in its features.&nbsp;
The exiguity of his stature arose from an entire abortion of the
legs, which, however, did not in the least affect his feet; nor
did the almost total absence of legs prevent the chief of the
tribe of Angti from being surprisingly active.&nbsp; He was
always running about with as much agility as the longest legged
of his people; he could not, indeed, make very extended strides,
but he compensated for this by the rapidity of his
movements.&nbsp; By dint of working about right and left,
skipping and jumping, he always arrived as soon as any one else;
he was, they said, the most expert horseman, and the most
intrepid warrior of the tribe.&nbsp; When they had once hoisted
him on his horse, where he held on, at once standing and seated,
he was invincible.&nbsp; In the popular assemblies, which the
mountaineers of these regions are in the habit of holding very
frequently, and always in the open air, to discuss all questions
of public and private interest, the chief Bomba always made
himself remarkable by the ascendancy of his eloquence and his
resolute character.&nbsp; When they were discussing at Angti the
tax on the oulah, no one was seen, no one heard, but the
astonishing Bomba.&nbsp; Perched on the shoulders of a big, tall
Thibetian, he pervaded, like a giant, the tumultuous assembly,
and dominated it, by word and gesture, still more than by his
factitious stature.</p>
<p><!-- page 286--><a name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
286</span>The chief of Angti omitted no opportunity of giving us
special proofs of kindness and sympathy.&nbsp; One day, he
invited us to dine with him.&nbsp; This invitation served the
double end of exercising towards us the duty of hospitality, and,
in the next place, of piquing the jealousy of the Chinese, whom
he hated and despised with all his soul.&nbsp; After dinner,
which offered nothing remarkable but a profusion of uncooked and
boiled meat, and tea richly saturated with butter, he asked us to
go and see a saloon full of pictures and armour of every
description.&nbsp; The pictures which lined the walls consisted
of portraits, rudely coloured, representing the most illustrious
ancestors of the family of Bomba.&nbsp; We observed there, a
numerous collection of Lamas of every age and dignity, and some
warriors in war costume.&nbsp; The arms were numerous, and in
great variety.&nbsp; There were lances, arrows, two-edged sabres,
spiral and scythe-shaped; tridents; long sticks with large iron
rings, and matchlocks, the stocks of which were of most singular
shapes.&nbsp; The defensive arms were round bucklers of the hide
of the wild yak, ornamented with red copper nails; armlets and
greaves of copper, and coats of mail of iron wire, of a thick and
close web, but, notwithstanding, very elastic.&nbsp; The chief
Bomba told us that these coats of mail were the armour of very
ancient times, which had been put aside since the use of the gun
had become general in their country.&nbsp; The Thibetians, as we
have said, are too indifferent in matters of chronology, to be
able to assign the time when they began to make use of
fire-arms.&nbsp; It may be presumed, however, that they were not
acquainted with gunpowder until towards the thirteenth century,
in the time of the wars of Tchingghiskhan, who had, as we know,
artillery in his army.&nbsp; A rather remarkable circumstance is,
that in the mountains of Thibet, as well as in the Chinese empire
and the plains of Tartary, there is no one but knows how to make
powder.&nbsp; Every family makes it for its own use.&nbsp; In
passing through the province of Kham, we often remarked women and
children busily employed in pounding coal, sulphur, and
saltpetre.&nbsp; The powder thus made is certainly not so good as
that of Europe, yet, when it is put in a fusil, with a ball upon
it, it is sufficiently potent to project the ball, and make it
kill stags in hunting, and men in battle.</p>
<p>After five days&rsquo; repose, we resumed our route.&nbsp;
Immediately at the outset, the caravan began to ascend the lofty
mountain of Angti.&nbsp; We met neither red horse nor white
knight, and no genius took us on his crupper, to bear us away to
his solitary abode.&nbsp; On every side, we saw only snow, but
that snow was so abundant that even on the most noted mountains,
we had never found so frightful a quantity.&nbsp; Frequently the
guides, mounted upon long-haired oxen, <!-- page 287--><a
name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 287</span>entirely
disappeared in gulfs, from which they could only disengage
themselves with great difficulty.&nbsp; More than once we were on
the point of retracing our steps, and giving up all hopes of
reaching the summit.</p>
<p>The small Sinico-Thibetian caravan that had joined us at
Tsiamdo, and that had never left us since, presented a spectacle
worthy of the utmost compassion.&nbsp; We forgot, in some degree,
our own sufferings, when we saw these poor little creatures
almost at every step buried in the snow, and with hardly strength
enough to cry.&nbsp; We admired the intrepid energy of the
Thibetian mother, who, so to speak, multiplied herself, in order
to rush to the assistance of her numerous offspring, and who
derived, from maternal tenderness, superhuman strength.</p>
<p>The mountain of Angti is so lofty and steep, that it took us
the whole day to ascend and descend it.&nbsp; The sun had already
set when we managed to roll to the bottom.&nbsp; We halted a few
minutes, under some black tents inhabited by nomad shepherds,
swallowed a few handsful of tsamba, diluted with brackish tea,
and then resumed our route along a rocky valley where the snow
was all melted.&nbsp; We followed for two hours, in utter
darkness, the steep banks of a river, of which we heard the
waters without seeing them.&nbsp; Every instant we trembled lest
we should be precipitated into it; but the animals, which knew
the road, and which we left to their instinct, conducted us
safely to Djaya.</p>
<p>Our arrival in the middle of the night put all the town in
commotion.&nbsp; The dogs, by their fierce barking, gave the
alarm.&nbsp; Soon after, the doors of the houses were opened, and
the inhabitants of the town rushed out in a crowd into the
streets, with horn lanterns, torches, and weapons of every
description, the general impression being that there was an
invasion of the enemy.&nbsp; However, when they observed the
peaceful and even timid bearing of the caravan, their
apprehensions were quieted, and each person returned home.&nbsp;
It was past midnight before we were able to get to sleep, having
previously resolved to stay a day at Djaya, with a view to take a
few hours&rsquo; rest after crossing the famous mountain of
Angti,&mdash;not more than was necessary.</p>
<p>Djaya is, as we have stated already, the residence of the
young Lama Houtouktou, who at the time was warring with the
Houtouktou of Tsiamdo.&nbsp; The town, situated in a beautiful
valley, is tolerably large; but, at the time we passed through
it, it was half in ruins; scarce twenty days had elapsed since it
had been attacked by the partisans of the Grand Houtouktou.&nbsp;
The two parties, we were informed, had had terrific combats,
wherein on both sides the victims had been numerous.&nbsp; In
passing through the town, we <!-- page 288--><a
name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 288</span>found whole
quarters laid waste by fire; nothing remained but enormous heaps
of calcined stones, and woodwork reduced to ashes.&nbsp; All the
trees of the valley had been cut down, and the trampling of
horses had utterly laid waste the cultivated fields.&nbsp; The
celebrated Lamasery of Djaya was deserted, the cells of the Lamas
and the wall, for more than 400 yards in circuit, which
surrounded them, had been demolished, and presented nothing but a
terrible mass of ruins.&nbsp; The assailants had only respected
the principal temples of Buddha.</p>
<p>The Chinese government keeps at Djaya a small garrison,
composed of twenty soldiers, commanded by a Tsien-Tsoung and a
Pa-Tsoung.&nbsp; These military gentlemen wore anything but a
satisfied aspect.&nbsp; They seemed to be very indifferently
pleased in this country, a prey to all the horrors of civil
war.&nbsp; The warlike attitude of the mountaineers left them no
rest, day or night.&nbsp; It was in vain they tried to preserve
neutrality, or rather to have the appearance of belonging to both
parties; they none the less found themselves constantly between
two fires.&nbsp; It would appear, indeed, that Djaya has never
furnished to the Chinese an easy and agreeable residence.&nbsp;
At all times, Chinese domination has met with invincible
resistance from the fierce tribes around it.&nbsp; The Chinese
Itinerary, which was written in the reign of the Emperor
Kien-Long, expresses itself thus concerning these countries:
&ldquo;The Thibetians, who inhabit the district of Djaya, are of
a haughty and fierce character; all attempts to subdue them have
been fruitless, they are considered very ferocious; it is their
natural character.&rdquo;&nbsp; What the Chinese writer calls
&ldquo;fierce character,&rdquo; is nothing more in reality than
ardent patriotism, and a very just hatred of a foreign yoke.</p>
<p>A day&rsquo;s rest having sufficiently repaired our strength,
we quitted Djaya.&nbsp; It is unnecessary to add that the Chinese
were obliged to pay, and in ready money, for the hire of the
oulah.&nbsp; The Thibetians of the country were too ferocious to
furnish us gratuitously with oxen and horses.&nbsp; We travelled
for two days, through a country extremely low, where we
frequently found small villages and black tents grouped in the
valleys.&nbsp; We were often obliged to traverse wooden bridges,
in order to cross sometimes calm and quiet streams, and at other
times torrents, the impetuous waters of which rolled on with a
terrible noise.&nbsp; Shortly before our arrival at the station
of Adzou-Thang, we overtook the party which was accompanying the
coffin of the deceased Liang-Tai to Bagoung.&nbsp; The son also
had just died in a black tent, after a few hours&rsquo; frightful
agony.&nbsp; The caravan, having no chief, was in a complete
state of disorganisation; most of the soldiers of the escort had
dispersed, after pillaging the baggage of their Mandarin; three
only had <!-- page 289--><a name="page289"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 289</span>remained, who were devising the best
means of effecting the conveying of the two bodies to
China.&nbsp; They despaired of being able to continue their
journey in so small a number; so that the arrival of our caravan
extricated them from a great difficulty.&nbsp; The conveyance of
the father&rsquo;s body had been arranged at Bagoung; that of the
son remained unsettled.&nbsp; The carriers of his palanquin had
refused to undertake the carriage, for they foresaw that there
would not be money enough to pay them for their trouble.&nbsp; To
place the coffin on an ox was impracticable; there was no
inducing a Thibetian guide to allow one of their animals to carry
a corpse, much less the corpse of a Chinese.&nbsp; We were
obliged to have recourse to stratagem.&nbsp; The body of the last
deceased Mandarin was secretly cut into four pieces, and then
packed in a box, which we put among the general luggage, making
the Thibetians believe that in honour of filial piety, the body
of the son had been laid beside that of his father, in the same
coffin.</p>
<p>The two corpses, that had become our fellow-travellers,
communicated to the caravan a mournful aspect, which had great
influence upon the Chinese imagination.&nbsp; Ly, the pacificator
of kingdoms, whose strength decreased daily, was particularly
alarmed by the circumstance; he would fain have removed the sad
spectacle, but this he could not effect without exposing himself
to the terrible accusation of having impeded the sepulture of two
Mandarins, who had died in a foreign country.</p>
<p>From Adzou-Thang, we went on to sleep and change oulah in a
small village of the valley of Che-Pan-Keou (Valley of
Slates).&nbsp; According to the testimony of the Chinese
Itinerary, the inhabitants of this valley are a rude, wicked, and
obstinate people; that is to say, in other words, they do not
fear the Chinese, and are in the habit of making them pay a good
price for the yaks and horses with which they furnish them.</p>
<p>The valley of Che-Pan-Keou, as its name indicates, abounds in
quarries of argillaceous schist.&nbsp; The Thibetians of these
countries raise from them beautiful slate, which they use in
tiling their houses; they also raise very thick pieces, upon
which they engrave images of Buddha with the form, &ldquo;Om mane
padme houm.&rdquo;&nbsp; This slate is of very fine
texture.&nbsp; The small portions of mica or talc which they
contain, give them a brilliant and silky lustre.</p>
<p>The stream which flows through the centre of the valley,
contains a large quantity of gold dust, which the natives do not
neglect to collect and refine.&nbsp; As we walked along the
stream, we found fragments of crucibles, to which were still
attached a few particles of gold; we showed them to the
Pacificator of Kingdoms, and this sight seemed to reanimate his
strength, and to <!-- page 290--><a name="page290"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 290</span>renew the bonds which attached him
to life.&nbsp; The blood suddenly rushed into his face, his eyes,
which had been almost extinct, shone with an unwonted fire.&nbsp;
One would have said that the sight of a few grains of gold had
made him completely forget both his malady and the two corpses
which accompanied him.</p>
<p>Musk deer abound in this schistous valley.&nbsp; Although that
animal, addicted to cold climates, is met with on almost all the
mountains of Thibet, nowhere, perhaps, is it seen in such large
numbers as in the neighbourhood of Che-Pan-Keou.&nbsp; The pines,
cedars, hollies, and cypresses, which cover this country,
contribute, no doubt, a good deal to attract these animals
thither, peculiarly fond, as they are, of the roots of these
trees, which have a strong aromatic perfume.</p>
<p>The musk deer is of the height of a goat; it has a small head;
its nose is pointed, and ornamented with long white mustachios;
its legs are small, its haunches large and thick; two long
crooked teeth, which grow out of the upper jaw, enable it to tear
up from the ground the odoriferous roots, upon which it subsists;
its hair is generally from two to three inches long, and is
hollow, like that of almost all the animals which live north of
the Himalaya mountains; extremely rough, and always bristling;
its colour is black below, white in the middle, and inclining to
grey above.&nbsp; A bladder, suspended from the belly, near the
navel, contains the precious substance, the musk.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of the schistous valley capture in the chase
such a number of these musk deer, that you see nothing in their
houses but the skins of these animals, hung on the walls by
pegs.&nbsp; They use the hair to stuff the thick cushions, on
which they sit during the day, and the sort of mattress which
serves them for a bed; they have in the musk the source of a very
lucrative trade with the Chinese.</p>
<p>The day after our arrival at Che-Pan-Keou, we bade farewell to
the inhabitants of the valley, and proceeded on our way.&nbsp; At
the three next stations, they were quite inexorable on the
question of the oulah.&nbsp; The Chinese were disgusted at the
behaviour of these rude mountaineers, who, as they said, did not
comprehend hospitality, and had no notion of what was right and
what was wrong.&nbsp; As to us, on the contrary, we sympathized
with these men and their rude, spirited temperament; their
manners, it is true, were not refined, but their natural
disposition was generosity and frankness itself, and in our eyes
matter was of more moment than manner.&nbsp; At length we reached
Kiang-Tsa, and the Chinese now began to breathe more freely, for
we were entering upon a less hostile district.&nbsp; Kiang-Tsa is
a very fertile valley, the inhabitants of which <!-- page
291--><a name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
291</span>seem to live in plenty.&nbsp; We remarked among them,
besides the soldiers of the garrison, a great number of Chinese
from the provinces of Sse-Tchouen and Yun-Nan, who keep a few
shops and exercise the primary arts and trades.&nbsp; A few
years, they say, enable them, in this country, to amass a
tolerably large fortune.&nbsp; The two military Mandarins of
Kiang-Tsa, who had been companions in arms of Ly-Kouo-Ngan, were
alarmed at the deplorable state in which they found him, and
advised him strongly to continue his journey in a
palanquin.&nbsp; We joined our entreaties to theirs, and we were
fortunate enough to triumph over the avarice of the Pacificator
of Kingdoms.&nbsp; He appeared at last to comprehend that a dead
man had no need of money, and that first of all he should see to
the saving of his life.&nbsp; The son of the Mandarin Pei seemed
to have died just in the nick of time for placing at
Ly-Kouo-Ngan&rsquo;s disposal, his palanquin and his eight
Chinese bearers, all of whom were at Kiang-Tsa.&nbsp; We halted
for one day to repair the palanquin and to give the bearers time
to prepare their travelling sandals.</p>
<p>The countries which we passed to the south of Kiang-Tsa,
seemed to us less cold and less barren than those we had
journeyed through previously.&nbsp; The ground perceptibly
declined; we were still, indeed, completely surrounded by
mountains, but they gradually lost their savage and mournful
aspect.&nbsp; We no longer saw those threatening forms, those
gigantic masses of granite with sharp and perpendicular
declivities.&nbsp; High grass and forests showed themselves on
every side, cattle became more numerous, and everything announced
that we were rapidly advancing towards more temperate climes;
only the tops of the mountains still preserved their crowns of
snow and ice.</p>
<p>Four days after our departure from Kiang-Tsa, we reached the
banks of the Kin-Cha-Kiang (River of Gold-dust), which we had
already crossed on the ice with the Thibetian ambassador, two
months before our arrival at Lha-Ssa.&nbsp; Amid the beautiful
plains of China, this magnificent river rolls on its blue waves
with an imposing majesty; but among the mountains of Thibet, it
is ever bounding about, throwing the great mass of its waters to
the bottom of gorges and valleys, with terrible impetuosity and
noise.&nbsp; At the spot where we came to the river, it was
enclosed between two mountains, the sharp flanks of which, rising
perpendicularly on its banks, made for it a narrow but extremely
deep bed; the waters ran rapidly, sending forth a low and
lugubrious sound.&nbsp; From time to time, we saw huge masses of
ice approach, which, after having whirled round in a thousand
eddies, at last were dashed to pieces against the sharp
projections of the mountain.</p>
<p>We followed the right bank of the Kin-Cha-Kiang for half a
<!-- page 292--><a name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
292</span>day.&nbsp; Towards noon, we reached a small village,
where we found everything prepared beforehand for crossing the
river.&nbsp; The caravan divided itself among four flat boats,
and, in a little while, we were on the opposite bank.&nbsp; Near
it, at the entrance to a narrow valley, was the station of
Tchon-Pa-Loung.&nbsp; The Dheba of the place furnished us, by way
of supper, with some excellent fresh fish; and, for sleeping,
with a very snug wind-tight chamber, and thick mattresses stuffed
with the hair of the musk deer.</p>
<p>Next day we travelled along a small river, which subsequently
joins the River of Gold-dust.&nbsp; Our hearts were lighter than
usual, for we had been told that we should arrive the same day in
a charming country.&nbsp; As we went along, we accordingly looked
first on one side and then on the other, with an uneasy
curiosity; from time to time we rose on our stirrups in order to
see further; but the landscape was a long time before it became
poetical.&nbsp; On our left we had still the aforesaid river,
prosaically running over great stones, and on our right a large
red mountain, dismal, bare, and cut up in all directions by deep
ravines; masses of white clouds, driven onward by a cutting wind,
flitted over the sides of the mountain, and formed, ahead of us,
a sombre horizon of mist.</p>
<p>Towards midday, the caravan halted at some ruins, to drink a
cup of tea and eat a handful of tsamba; we then clambered to the
top of the red mountain, and from the height of this great
observatory, admired on our right the magnificent, the enchanting
plain of Bathang. <a name="citation292"></a><a
href="#footnote292" class="citation">[292]</a>&nbsp; We found
ourselves, all at once transported, as it were by magic, into the
presence of a country which offered to our view all the wonders
of the richest and most varied vegetation.&nbsp; The contrast,
above all, was striking.&nbsp; On one side, a sombre, barren,
mountainous region, almost throughout a desert; on the other, on
the contrary, a joyous plain, where numerous inhabitants occupied
themselves in fertile fields, in the labours of
agriculture.&nbsp; The Chinese Itinerary says, &ldquo;The canton
of Bathang is a beautiful plain, a thousand lis in length, well
watered by streams and springs; the sky there is clear, the
climate pleasant, and everything gladdens the heart and the eyes
of man.&rdquo;&nbsp; We quickly descended the mountain, and
continued our journey in a real garden, amid flowering trees and
verdant rice fields.&nbsp; A delicious warmth gradually
penetrated our limbs, and we soon felt our furred dresses
oppressive; it was nearly two years since we had perspired, and
it seemed very odd to be warm without being before a good
fire.</p>
<p>Near the town of Bathang, the soldiers of the garrison were
drawn up in line, to do military honours to the Pacificator of
<!-- page 293--><a name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
293</span>Kingdoms, who, perched up, at the bottom of his
palanquin, went through the ranks in a very unwarlike
manner.&nbsp; The Thibetian population, who were all on foot,
accompanied the caravan to a beautiful Chinese pagoda which was
to serve for our lodging.&nbsp; The same evening, the Mandarins
of the Chinese garrison and the Grand Lamas of the town, came to
pay us a visit, and to offer us some beef and mutton, butter,
corn, candles, bacon, rice, nuts, raisins, apricots, and other
products of the country.</p>
<p>At Bathang, there is a magazine of provisions, the fourth from
Lha-Ssa; it is, like all the others, managed by a literary
Mandarin, bearing the title of Liang-Tai.&nbsp; The Chinese
garrison, consisting of three hundred soldiers, is commanded by a
Cheou-Pei, two Tsien-Tsoung, and a Pa-Tsoung.&nbsp; The annual
maintenance of the Chinese troops, who belong to this post,
amounts to nine thousand ounces of silver, without reckoning the
rations of rice and tsamba.&nbsp; We observed, among the
population of Bathang, a very great number of Chinese; they are
engaged in various arts and trades; several of them, indeed,
occupy themselves with agriculture, and make the most of the
Thibetian farms.&nbsp; This plain, which you find, as by
enchantment, amid the mountains of Thibet, is wonderfully
fertile: it produces two harvests each year.&nbsp; Its principal
products are, rice, maize, barley, wheat, peas, cabbages,
turnips, onions, and several other varieties of vegetable.&nbsp;
Of fruits, you find grapes, pomegranates, peaches, apricots, and
water melons.&nbsp; Honey is also very abundant there.&nbsp;
Lastly, you find there mines of cinnabar (sulphur of mercury),
from which they extract a large quantity of mercury.&nbsp; The
Thibetians get the mercury in all its purity, by disengaging the
sulphur by combustion, or by combining it with slack-lime.</p>
<p>The town of Bathang is large and very populous, and its
inhabitants seem to be well off.&nbsp; The Lamas there are very
numerous, as they are in all the Thibetian towns.&nbsp; The
principal Lamasery, which they call the Grand Monastery of Ba,
has for its superior a Khampo, who holds his spiritual authority
from the Tal&eacute;-Lama of Lha-Ssa.</p>
<p>The temporal power of the Tal&eacute;-Lama ends at
Bathang.&nbsp; The frontiers of Thibet, properly so called, were
fixed in 1726, on the termination of a great war between the
Thibetians and the Chinese.&nbsp; Two days before you arrive at
Bathang, you pass, on the top of the Mang-Ling mountain, a stone
monument, showing what was arranged at that time between the
government of Lha-Ssa and that of Peking, on the subject of
boundaries.&nbsp; At present, the countries situate east of
Bathang are independent of Lha-Ssa in temporal matters.&nbsp;
They are governed by the Tou-Sse, a sort of feudal princes, <!--
page 294--><a name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
294</span>originally appointed by the Chinese Emperor, and still
acknowledging his paramount authority.</p>
<p>These petty sovereigns are bound to go every third year to
Peking, to offer their tribute to the Emperor.</p>
<p>We halted at Bathang three days, the illness of our guide
Ly-Kouo-Ngan, being the cause of this delay.&nbsp; The daily
fatigues of this long journey had so overpowered the poor
Mandarin, that he was in an almost hopeless state.&nbsp; His best
plan was to take advantage of the fine climate of Bathang, and to
let the caravan proceed on its way.&nbsp; His friends advised him
to do so, but without success.&nbsp; He insisted upon continuing
his journey, and sought, in every way, to deceive himself as to
the serious nature of his malady.&nbsp; As for us, we considered
his case so dangerous, that we felt it our duty to profit by the
repose we enjoyed at Bathang, to talk seriously to him on the
subject of his soul and of eternity.&nbsp; Our previous
conversations on the way had already sufficiently enlightened him
as to the principal truths of Christianity.&nbsp; Nothing now
remained but to make him clearly perceive his position, and to
convince him of the urgency of entering frankly and fully into
the path of salvation.&nbsp; Ly-Kouo-Ngan altogether concurred
with us, admitting our observations to be replete with
reason.&nbsp; He himself spoke with great eloquence on the
frailty and brevity of human life, of worldly vanities, of the
impenetrability of God&rsquo;s decrees, of the importance of
salvation, of the truth of the Christian religion, and of the
obligation on all mankind to embrace it.&nbsp; He said to us, on
all these subjects, some very sensible and very touching things;
but when it came to the point, to the practical result, to the
declaring himself Christian, there was a dead stand; he must
absolutely wait till he had returned to his family, and had
abdicated his mandarinate.&nbsp; It was in vain that we
represented to him the danger he incurred by postponing this
important matter; all was useless.&nbsp; &ldquo;So long as I am a
Mandarin of the Emperor,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I cannot serve
the Lord of Heaven,&rdquo; and he had got this absurd idea so
deep in his brain, that it was impracticable to dislodge it.</p>
<p>On leaving the station of Bathang, we were obliged to turn for
some distance, quite northwards, in order to resume an eastern
direction; for since our departure from Tsiamdo, we had
continually progressed towards the south during twenty
consecutive days.&nbsp; The caravans are compelled to lengthen
this route considerably, in order to reach a secure passage
across the great river Kin-Cha-Kiang.</p>
<p>Our first day&rsquo;s march from Bathang was full of charms,
for we travelled, in a delightful temperature, through a country
of an infinite variety of landscape.&nbsp; The narrow path we
followed was <!-- page 295--><a name="page295"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 295</span>throughout bordered with willows and
apricot trees in flower.&nbsp; Next day, however, we again found
ourselves amid all the horrors and dangers of our old
route.&nbsp; We had to ascend a very high mountain, upon which we
were mercilessly assailed by the snow and the north wind.&nbsp;
It was a complete reaction against the Sybaritism we had enjoyed
in the warm and flowery plain of Bathang.&nbsp; At the foot of
the mountain, the snow was succeeded by torrents of cold rain,
which seemed to filter through into the very marrow of our
bones.&nbsp; As a climax of misfortune, we were obliged to pass
the night in a habitation, the roof of which, cracked in several
places, gave free passage to the wind and rain.&nbsp; We were,
however, so exhausted with fatigue that this did not prevent our
sleeping.&nbsp; The next day we awoke in the mire; we found our
bedclothes entirely soaked, and our limbs stiff with cold.&nbsp;
We were obliged to rub ourselves violently with pieces of ice, in
order to restore circulation to the blood.&nbsp; The abominable
village, which afforded us this horrible lodging, bears the name
of Ta-So.&nbsp; On emerging from the valley of Ta-So, you ascend,
by a narrow gorge, an elevated plain, which we found covered with
snow.&nbsp; Here, we entered a magnificent forest, the finest we
had seen in the mountains of Thibet.&nbsp; The pines, cedars, and
hollies entwined their vigorous branches, and formed a dome of
verdure impenetrable to the sun, and under which there is much
better protection from the rain and snow than in the houses of
Ta-So.&nbsp; The trunks and branches of these large trees are
covered with thick moss, which extends in long and extremely
delicate filaments.&nbsp; When this stringy moss is new, it is of
a beautiful green hue; but when it is old, it is black, and bears
an exact resemblance to long tufts of dirty and ill-combed
hair.&nbsp; There is nothing more grotesque or fantastic than the
appearance of these old pines, with this very long hair suspended
from their branches.&nbsp; The prickly holly that grows on the
mountains of Thibet, is remarkable for the extraordinary
development it attains.&nbsp; In Europe, it never exceeds the
size of a shrub, but here, it always grows to the size of a large
tree.&nbsp; If it does not rise as high as the pine, it equals it
in the size of its trunk, and it is even superior to it in the
richness and abundance of its foliage.</p>
<p>This day&rsquo;s march was long and fatiguing.&nbsp; The night
had set in when we reached the station of Samba, where we were to
change the oulah.&nbsp; We were just going to bed, when we missed
a Thibetian, belonging to the escort, precisely the very man who
had been assigned as our servant.&nbsp; We sought him, but
without success, in every corner of the small village in which we
had arrived.&nbsp; We concluded he had lost his way in the
forest.&nbsp; We at first thought <!-- page 296--><a
name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 296</span>of sending
in search of him, but in so dark a night, how could one possibly
find a man in that vast and thick forest?&nbsp; We contented
ourselves with going in a body to a neighbouring hill, where we
shouted, and lit a large fire.&nbsp; Towards midnight, the lost
man reappeared, almost dead with fatigue.&nbsp; He carried on his
back the saddle of his horse, which, no doubt, finding the
journey too long, had thought fit to lie down in the midst of the
forest, and it had been impossible to get him up again.&nbsp; The
return of this poor young man filled every one with joy, and we
all then went to rest.</p>
<p>The next day, we rose late.&nbsp; Whilst the inhabitants of
Samba were bringing the horses and the beasts of burden to form
the caravan, we went for a little walk, and to have a view of the
place, which we had reached over night.&nbsp; The village of
Samba is a collection of thirty small houses, built of large
flint stones, rudely cemented, some with argols, others with
mud.&nbsp; The aspect of the village is mournful, but the
environs are tolerably cheerful.&nbsp; Two streams, one coming
from the west, the other from the south, join near the village,
and form a river, the transparent waters of which flow over a
vast prairie.&nbsp; A small wooden bridge, painted red, herds of
goats and long-haired cattle, which sported amid the pastures,
some storks and wild ducks, fishing for their breakfast on the
banks of the water, a few gigantic cypresses here and there, even
the smoke which rose from the Thibetian cottages, and which the
wind gently wafted over the adjacent hills, all contributed to
give life and charm to the landscape.&nbsp; The sky was clear and
serene.&nbsp; Already the sun, having risen a little above the
horizon, promised us a fine day, and a mild temperature.</p>
<p>We returned to our lodgings, walking slowly.&nbsp; The caravan
was ready, and on the point of departure; the beasts were laden
with their burdens; the horsemen, their robes tucked up, and whip
in hand, were ready to mount.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are behind
hand,&rdquo; said we, &ldquo;let us make haste,&rdquo; and at a
run we were in our places.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why are you in such a
hurry?&rdquo; said a Chinese soldier, &ldquo;Ly-Kouo-Ngan is not
ready; he has not yet opened the door of his room.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;To-day,&rdquo; answered we, &ldquo;there is no great
mountain a-head; the weather is fine: there is no objection to
our starting a little later; go, however, and tell the Mandarin
that the caravan is ready.&rdquo;&nbsp; The soldier pushed open
the door, and entered the chamber of Ly-Kouo-Ngan; he rushed out
again pale and with haggard eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ly-Kouo-Ngan is
dead!&rdquo; said he to us, in a low tone.&nbsp; We rushed into
the room, and saw the unfortunate Mandarin, stretched on his bed,
his mouth open, his teeth clenched, and his eyes shrunk up by
death.&nbsp; We placed our hands on his heart, which gently
moved.&nbsp; He had yet a spark of life in him, but <!-- page
297--><a name="page297"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
297</span>hope was vain; the dying man had altogether lost the
use of senses; there was another rattle or two in his throat, and
he expired.&nbsp; The humours with which his legs were swollen,
had gone up to his chest, and suffocated him.</p>
<p>The death of our guide had not been unexpected; there was
nothing in it to surprise us, but it occurred in such a sudden,
melancholy manner, that every one of us was greatly
agitated.&nbsp; As for ourselves, in particular, we were
afflicted at it beyond all expression.&nbsp; We bitterly
regretted that it had not been our good fortune to assist at the
last moments of this unfortunate man, whom we had so desired to
bring from the darkness of paganism into the light of the
faith.&nbsp; Oh, how impenetrable are the decrees of God!&nbsp;
Some hope, however, mingled with our but too just grounds for
fear.&nbsp; As this poor soul had been sufficiently enlightened
as to the truths of religion, it is permissible to suppose that
God, of his infinite mercy, perhaps accorded to him, in his last
moments, the grace of the baptism of volition.</p>
<p>That day the caravan did not proceed on its march, the animals
were unsaddled and sent out to pasture; and then the soldiers of
the escort made all the necessary preparations, according to the
Chinese rites, for conveying the body of their Mandarin to his
family.&nbsp; We will not enter here into the details of what was
done in this matter, for whatever concerns the manners and
customs and ceremonies of the Chinese, will find a place
elsewhere.&nbsp; We will merely say that the defunct was
enveloped in a large white pall, which had been given him by the
Living Buddha of Djachi-Loumbo, and which was covered with
Thibetian sentences, and with images of Buddha, printed in
black.</p>
<p>The Thibetians, and other Buddhists, have unlimited confidence
in the printed winding-sheets which are distributed by the
Tal&eacute;-Lama and the Bandchan-Remboutchi.&nbsp; They are
persuaded that those who are fortunate enough to be buried in
them, cannot fail to have a happy transmigration.</p>
<p>By the demise of Ly-Kouo-Ngan, the caravan found itself
without a leader and without a guide.&nbsp; There was, to be
sure, the Lama Dsiamdchang, to whom the power should have fallen
by right, and by legitimate succession; but the Chinese soldiers
being very little disposed to acknowledge his authority, we
passed from the monarchic state to the republican, democratical
form.&nbsp; This state of things lasted at most half-a-day.&nbsp;
Perceiving that the men of the caravan, both Thibetians and
Chinese, were not yet prepared for so perfect a government, and
considering that anarchy was developing itself in every
direction, and that matters threatened to go to rack and ruin,
consulting only the public interest and the <!-- page 298--><a
name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 298</span>safety of
the caravan, we assumed the dictatorship.&nbsp; We immediately
issued several decrees, in order that everything might be in
readiness for us to proceed on the morrow at daybreak.&nbsp; The
necessity of being governed was so completely understood, that no
one made any opposition, and we were obeyed punctually.</p>
<p>At the appointed time, we left Samba.&nbsp; The caravan bore a
sad and melancholy aspect.&nbsp; With its three corpses, it
absolutely resembled a funeral procession.&nbsp; After three
days&rsquo; march across mountains, where we generally found
wind, snow, and cold, we arrived at the station of Lithang
(copper plain).&nbsp; The Chinese government keeps here a
magazine of provisions, and a garrison consisting of 100
soldiers.&nbsp; The Mandarins of Lithang are: a Liang-Tai, a
Cheou-Pei, and two Pa-Tsoung.&nbsp; A few minutes after our
arrival, these gentlemen came to pay us a visit.&nbsp; In the
first place, the illness and death of our guide were discussed at
full length; then we were required to state our quality, and by
what authority and in what position we were in the caravan.&nbsp;
By way of answer, we simply showed him a large scroll, fortified
with the seal and signature of the ambassador Ki-Chan, and
containing the instructions which had been given to Ly-Kouo-Ngan
about us.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good, good,&rdquo; said these persons to
us, &ldquo;the death of Ly-Kouo-Ngan will make no change in your
position; you shall be well treated wherever you go.&nbsp; Up to
this time you have always lived peaceably with the men of the
caravan, doubtless this good understanding will continue to the
end.&rdquo;&nbsp; We hoped so too.&nbsp; Yet, as considering
human frailty, difficulties might possibly arise on the way,
particularly among the Chinese soldiers, we wished to have with
us a responsible Mandarin.&nbsp; We made this request, and were
informed that of the four Mandarins who were at Lithang, not one
could be spared to conduct us; that we could go along quietly
enough as far as the frontiers, with our Thibetian and Chinese
escort; and that there we should readily find a Mandarin to
conduct us to the capital of Sse-Tchouen.&nbsp; &ldquo;Very
well,&rdquo; said we, &ldquo;as you cannot give us a Mandarin we
shall travel as we think fit, and go where we please.&nbsp; We
are not even sure that on quitting this place we shall not return
to Lha-Ssa.&nbsp; You see that we deal freely with you; reflect
upon the point.&rdquo;&nbsp; Our four magistrates rose, saying
that they would deliberate on this important matter, and that in
the evening we should have an answer.</p>
<p>During our supper, a Pa-Tsoung, one of the four Mandarins,
presented himself in his state robes.&nbsp; After the usual
compliments, he told us that he had been selected to command our
escort as far as the frontiers; that he had never, in his dreams
of ambition, imagined he should have the honour of conducting
people such as <!-- page 299--><a name="page299"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 299</span>we; that he was ashamed on the first
day of seeing us, to have to ask us a favour; it was, that we
would rest for two days at Lithang, in order to recover our
strength, which must be exhausted by so long and arduous a
journey.&nbsp; We perceived that our friend had need of two days
to arrange some affairs of his own, previous to a journey which
he had not expected.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; we replied,
&ldquo;already how full of solicitude is your heart for us.&nbsp;
We will rest then two days as you wish it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Authority
having been thus reorganized, our dictatorship was at an
end.&nbsp; But we thought we perceived that this was anything but
agreeable to our people, who would much rather have had to do
with us than with a Mandarin.</p>
<p>The town of Lithang is built on the sides of a hill which
rises in the middle of a plain, broad but almost sterile.&nbsp;
Nothing grows there but a little barley, and a few poor herbs,
which serve for pasturage to some miserable herds of goats and
yaks.&nbsp; Seen from a distance, the town has some
promise.&nbsp; Two large Lamaseries, richly painted and gilt,
which are built quite on the top of the hill, especially
contribute to give it an imposing aspect.&nbsp; But, when you
pass through the interior, you find nothing but ugly, dirty,
narrow streets, so steep, that your legs must be accustomed to
mountain travelling, to keep their equilibrium.&nbsp; This side
of the River of Gold-dust, you observe among the tribes a rather
remarkable modification in the manners, customs, costume, and
even in the language.&nbsp; You see that you are no longer in
Thibet, properly so called.&nbsp; As you approach the frontiers
of China, the natives have less ferocity and rudeness in their
character; you find them more covetous, flattering, and cunning;
their religious faith is no longer so vivid, nor so frank.&nbsp;
As to the language, it is no longer the pure Thibetian that is
spoken at Lha-Ssa, and in the province of Kham; it is a dialect
closely connected with the idiom of the Si-Fan, and in which you
remark various Chinese expressions.&nbsp; The Thibetians of
Lha-Ssa who accompanied us had the greatest difficulty in the
world in understanding and being understood.&nbsp; The costume,
for the most part, only differs as to the head-dress.&nbsp; The
men wear a hat of grey or brown felt, somewhat similar to our own
felt hats when they first come from the hatter&rsquo;s board and
have not been rounded to the form.&nbsp; The women form with
their hair a number of small tresses, which flow over their
shoulders.&nbsp; They then place on their heads a large silver
plate, somewhat similar to a dinner-plate.&nbsp; The more elegant
wear two of these, one on each side, so that the two ends meet
above the head.&nbsp; The precept of daubing the face with black,
does not apply to the women of Lithang.&nbsp; This kind of toilet
operates only in the countries temporally subject to the
Tal&eacute;-Lama.</p>
<p><!-- page 300--><a name="page300"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
300</span>The most important of the Lamaseries of Lithang
possesses a great printing press for Buddhic books, and it is
hither that, on holidays, the Lamas of the neighbouring countries
come for their supplies.&nbsp; Lithang carries on also a large
trade in gold dust, in chaplets of black beads, and in cups made
with the roots of the vine and box-tree.&nbsp; As we departed
from Lithang, the Chinese garrison was under arms, to render
military honours to Ly-Kouo-Ngan.&nbsp; They acted just as if he
had been alive.&nbsp; When the coffin passed, all the soldiers
bent their knees and exclaimed: &ldquo;To the Tou-Sse,
Ly-Kouo-Ngan, the poor garrison of Lithang wishes health and
prosperity.&rdquo;&nbsp; The petty Mandarin, with the white
button, who had become our guide, saluted the garrison in the
name of the deceased.&nbsp; This new commander of the caravan was
a Chinese of Moslem extraction; but one could find nothing about
him which seemed to belong in the least to the fine type of his
ancestors: his puny, stunted person, his pointed smiling face,
his shrill treble voice, his trifling manners, all contributed to
give him the air of a shop-boy, and not in the least that of a
military Mandarin.&nbsp; He was a prodigious talker.&nbsp; The
first day he rather amused us, but he soon became a bore.&nbsp;
He thought himself bound, in his quality of Mussulman, to talk to
us, on all occasions, about Arabia, and of its horses that are
sold for their weight in gold; about Mahomet, and his famous
sabre that cut through metals; about Mecca and its bronze
ramparts.</p>
<p>From Lithang to Ta-Tsien-Lou, a frontier town of China, is
only 600 lis, which are divided into eight stages.&nbsp; We found
the end of that frightful route to Thibet exactly like its middle
and its beginning.&nbsp; We in vain climbed mountains; we found
still more and more before us, all of a threatening aspect, all
covered with snow and rugged with precipices; nor did the
temperature undergo any perceptible change.&nbsp; It appeared to
us, that, since our departure from Lha-Ssa, we had been doing
nothing but move round and round in the same circle.&nbsp; Yet,
as we advanced, the villages became more frequent, without,
however, losing their Thibetian style.&nbsp; The most important
of these villages is Makian-Dsoung, where some Chinese merchants
keep stores for supplying the caravans.&nbsp; One day&rsquo;s
journey from Makian-Dsoung, you pass in a boat the
Ya-Loung-Kiang, a large and rapid river.&nbsp; Its source is at
the foot of the Bayen-Kharat mountains, close to that of the
Yellow River.&nbsp; It joins the Kin-Cha-Kiang, in the province
of Sse-Tchouen.&nbsp; According to the traditions of the country,
the banks of the Ya-Loung-Kiang were the first cradle of the
Thibetian nation.&nbsp; As we were passing the Ya-Loung-Kiang in
a boat, a shepherd crossed the same river on a bridge merely
composed of a thick rope of yak skin tightly stretched from one
bank to the other.&nbsp; A sort of <!-- page 301--><a
name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 301</span>wooden
stirrup was suspended by a solid strap to a moveable pulley on
the rope.&nbsp; The shepherd had only to place himself backwards,
under this strange bridge, with his feet on the stirrup, and hold
on to the rope with both his hands; he then pulled the rope
gently; 
<a href="images/p301.jpg">
<img class='clearcenter' alt=
"Iron Chain Bridge"
title=
"Iron Chain Bridge"
src="images/p301.jpg" />
</a> the mere weight of his body made the pulley move, and he
reached the other side in a very short time.&nbsp; These bridges
are very common in Thibet, and are very convenient for crossing
torrents and precipices; but one must be accustomed to
them.&nbsp; We ourselves never ventured on them.&nbsp; Iron chain
bridges also are much in <!-- page 302--><a
name="page302"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 302</span>use,
particularly in the provinces of Ouei and Dzang.&nbsp; To
construct them, as many iron hooks are fixed on both sides of the
river as there are to be chains, then the chains are fastened,
and on the chains planks, which are sometimes covered with a
coating of earth.&nbsp; As these bridges are extremely elastic,
they are furnished with hand-rails.</p>
<p>We arrived at length safe and sound at the frontiers of China,
where the climate of Thibet gave us a very cold farewell.&nbsp;
In crossing the mountain which precedes the town of Ta-Tsien-Lou,
we were almost buried in the snow, it fell so thick and fast; and
which accompanied us into the valley where stands the Chinese
town, which, in its turn, received us with a pelting rain.&nbsp;
It was in the early part of June, 1846, and three months since we
had departed from Lha-Ssa; according to the Chinese Itinerary, we
had travelled 5,050 lis.</p>
<p>Ta-Tsien-Lou signifies the forge of arrows, and this name was
given to the town, because in the year 234 of our era, General
Wou-Heou, while leading his army against the southern countries,
sent one of his lieutenants to establish there a forge of
arrows.&nbsp; This district has by turns belonged to the
Thibetians and to the Chinese; for the last hundred years it has
been considered as an integral part of the empire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The walls and fortifications of Ta-Tsien-Lou,&rdquo;
says the Chinese Itinerary, &ldquo;are of freestone.&nbsp;
Chinese and Thibetians dwell there together.&nbsp; It is thence
that the officers and troops, which are sent to Thibet quit
China.&nbsp; Though it passes also a large quantity of tea coming
from China, and destined to supply the provinces of Thibet, it is
at Ta-Tsien-Lou that is held the principal tea fair.&nbsp;
Although the inhabitants of this canton are very addicted to the
worship of Buddha, they seek to get a little profit; yet they are
sincere and just, submissive and obedient, so that nothing, even
death, can change their natural good nature.&nbsp; As they have
been long accustomed to the Chinese domination, they are the more
attached to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We rested three days at Ta-Tsien-Lou, and each day had several
quarrels with the principal Mandarin of the place, who would not
consent to our continuing our route in a palanquin.&nbsp;
However, he had at length to give way, for we could not bear even
the idea of mounting once more on horseback.&nbsp; Our legs had
bestrid so many horses of every age, size, quality, and colour,
that they refused to have anything further to do with horses at
all, and were full of an irresistible resolution to stretch
themselves at ease in a palanquin.&nbsp; This was granted them,
thanks to the perseverance and energy of our remonstrances.</p>
<p><!-- page 303--><a name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
303</span>The Thibetian escort which had accompanied us so
faithfully during the long and arduous route returned after two
days&rsquo; rest.&nbsp; We gave the Lama Dchiamdchang a letter
for the Regent, in which we thanked him for having assigned us so
devoted an escort, and which had throughout kept in our memory
the good treatment we had received at Lha-Ssa.&nbsp; On parting
from these good Thibetians we could not help shedding tears, for
insensibly, and as it were without our knowledge, ties had been
formed between us which it was painful to sever.&nbsp; The Lama
Dchiamdchang secretly told us that he had been charged to remind
us, at the moment of separation, of the promise we had made to
the Regent.&nbsp; He asked us if they might reckon on seeing us
again at Lha-Ssa.&nbsp; We replied that they might, for at that
time we were far from anticipating the nature of the obstacles
that were to prevent our return to Thibet.</p>
<p>The next morning, at daybreak, we entered our palanquins, and
were conveyed, at the public expense, to the capital of the
province of Sse-Tchouen, where, by order of the Emperor, we were
to undergo a solemn judgment before the Grand Mandarins of the
Celestial Empire.</p>
<h2>POSTSCRIPT.</h2>
<p>After a few months journey through China, we arrived at Macao,
in the early part of October, 1846.&nbsp; Our long and painful
journey was at an end; and at last we were able, after so many
tribulations, to enjoy a little quiet and repose.&nbsp; During
two years we applied our leisure moments to the preparation of
the few notes made in our journey.&nbsp; Hence these
&ldquo;Reminiscences of Travel,&rdquo; which we address to our
European brethren, whose charity will no doubt be interested in
the trials and fatigues of the missionaries.</p>
<p>Our entrance into China, for the purpose of returning to our
mission in Mongol-Tartary, compels us to leave unfinished the
labour we had undertaken.&nbsp; It remains for us to speak of our
relations with the Chinese tribunals and Mandarins, to give a
sketch of the provinces we have traversed, and to compare them
with those which we had occasion to visit in our former travels
in the Celestial Empire.&nbsp; This omission we will endeavour to
supply in the leisure hours we may be able to snatch from the
labours of the sacred ministry.&nbsp; Perhaps we shall be in a
position to give some correct notions about a country, of which,
at no time, certainly, have men&rsquo;s <!-- page 304--><a
name="page304"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 304</span>ideas been
so erroneous as they are at this day.&nbsp; Not that we are
without abundant books about China and the Chinese.&nbsp; On the
contrary, the number of works on these subjects that have
appeared in France, and particularly in England, within the last
few years, is really prodigious.&nbsp; But the zeal of a writer
will not always suffice to describe countries in which he has
never set his foot.&nbsp; To write travels in China, after a
saunter or two through the factories of Canton and the environs
of Macao, involves the danger of speaking of things that one is
not thoroughly acquainted with.&nbsp; Although it has been the
good fortune of the learned orientalist, J. Klaproth, to discover
the Potocki Archipelago without quitting his closet, it is,
generally speaking, rather difficult to make discoveries in a
country which one has not visited.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
